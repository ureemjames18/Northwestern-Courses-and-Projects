In 2018, 70 percent of higher education graduates had used loans to cover some or all of their expenses. With notable exceptions, student loans must be repaid, in contrast to other forms of financial aid such as scholarships, which are not repaid, and grants, which rarely have to be repaid. Student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy, but this is difficult. Research shows that access to student loans increases credit-constrained students\\' degree completion, later-life earnings, and student loan repayment while having no impact on overall debt.Student loan debt has proliferated since 2006, totaling $1.73 trillion by July 2021. In 2019, students who borrowed to complete a bachelor\\'s degree had about $30,000 of debt upon graduation.:\\u200a1\\u200a  Almost half of all loans are for graduate school, typically in much higher amounts.:\\u200a1\\u200a  Loan amounts vary widely based on race, social class, age, institution type, and degree sought. As of 2017, student debt constituted the largest non-mortgage liability for US households. Research indicates that increasing borrowing limits drives tuition increases.Student loan defaults are disproportionately common in the for-profit college sector. Around 2010, about 10 percent of college students attended for-profit colleges, but almost 40 percent of all defaults on federal student loans were to for-profit attendees. The schools whose students have the highest amount of debt are University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University. Except for Nova Southeastern, they are all for-profit. In 2018, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the 12-year student loan default rate for for-profit colleges was 52 percent.The default rate for borrowers who do not complete their degree is three times the rate for those who did.:\\u200a1\\u200a A Brookings Institution study from 2023 revealed that when the government pauses repayment on student loans, it most often \"...benefit[s] affluent borrowers the most...\" primarily due to affluent borrowers holding the largest student debt balances.\\n\\nHistory\\nFederal student loans were first offered in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act (NDEA). They were available only to select categories of students, such as those studying engineering, science, or education. The program was established in response to the Soviet Union\\'s launch of the Sputnik satellite. It addressed the widespread perception that the United States had fallen behind in science and technology. Student loans became more broadly available in the 1960s under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with the goal of encouraging greater social mobility and equal opportunity.In 1967, the publicly owned Bank of North Dakota made the first federally-insured student loan.The US first major government loan program was the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), formed in 1973.Before 2010, federal loans included:\\n\\nloans originated and funded directly by the Department of Education (DOE)\\ngovernment guaranteed loans originated and funded by private investors.Direct-to-consumer private loans were the fastest-growing segment of education finance. The \"percentage of undergraduates obtaining private loans from 2003–04 to 2007–08 rose from 5 percent to 14 percent\" and was under legislative scrutiny due to the lack of school certification.The rules for disability discharge underwent major changes as a result of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. The regulations took effect July 1, 2010. In June 2010, the amount of student loan debt held by Americans exceeded the amount of credit card debt held by Americans. At that time, student loan debt totalled at least $830 billion, of which approximately 80% was federal and 20% was private. By the fourth quarter of 2015, total outstanding student loans owned and securitized had surpassed $1.3 trillion.Guaranteed loans were eliminated in 2010 through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act and replaced with direct loans. The Obama administration claimed that guaranteed loans benefited private companies at taxpayer expense but did not reduce student costs.The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) ended private-sector lending under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) starting July 1, 2010; all subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, PLUS loans, and Consolidation loans are under the Federal Direct Loan Program.As of July 1, 2013, borrowers determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration would be accepted for loan discharge if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle. As of January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 established that debt discharged due to the death or disability of the borrower was no longer treated as taxable income. (This provision is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025.)In an effort to improve the student loan market, LendKey, SoFi (Social Finance, Inc.) and CommonBond began offering student loans and refinancing at lower rates than traditional lenders, using an alumni-funded model. According to a 2016 analysis by online student loan marketplace Credible, about 8 million borrowers could qualify for refinancing.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\'s February 2017 Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit reported 11.2% of aggregate student loan debt was 90 or more days delinquent.On July 25, 2018, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued an order declaring that the Borrower Defense Program (enacted in November 2016), would be replaced with a stricter repayment policy, effective July 1, 2019. When a school closes for fraud before conferring degrees, students would have to prove that they were financially harmed. As of 2018, 10% of borrowers were in default after three years and 16 percent after five years.In 2019, President Donald Trump ordered loan forgiveness for permanently disabled veterans, saving 25,000 veterans an average of $30,000 each. The same year, Theresa Sweet and other student loan debtors filed a claim against the US Department of Education, arguing that they had been defrauded by their colleges. The debtors filed under a rule known as Borrower Defense to Repayment.In 2021, student loan servicers began dropping out of the federal student loan business, including FedLoan Servicing on July 8, Granite State Management and Resources on July 20, and Navient on September 28. According to Sallie Mae, as of 2021, 1 in 8 families lenders are using private student loans when federal financing doesn\\'t cover all college costs.In July 2021, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that private student loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy, following two other cases.In August 2021, the Biden administration announced it would use executive action to cancel $5.8 billion in student loans held by 323,000 people who are permanently disabled.Starting in March 2020, federal student loan borrowers received temporary relief from student loan payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This relief was subsequently extended multiple times, and is set to expire at the end of June 2023.According to repayment data released by the Education Department, in December 2021, just 1.2 percent of borrowers were continuing to pay down their loans during the over two years of optional deferment.In November 2022, federal judge William Alsup ruled for immediate relief for about 200,000 student debtors and in April 2023 US Supreme Justice Elana Kagan declined to grant emergency relief to three for-profit colleges.In February 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Biden v. Nebraska concerning President Biden\\'s order to cancel student loan debt for an estimated 40 million debtors.In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nebraska to block Biden\\'s plan to forgive federal student loans.\\n\\nOverview\\nStudent loans play a significant role in U.S. higher education. Nearly 20 million Americans attend college each year, of whom close to 12 million –  or 60% –  borrow annually to help cover costs. As of 2021, approximately 45 million Americans held student debt, with an average balance of approximately $30,000.In Europe, higher education receives more government funding, making student loans less common. In parts of Asia and Latin America government funding for post-secondary education is lower –  usually limited to flagship universities, like UNAM in Mexico –  and government programs under which students can borrow money are uncommon.In the United States, college is funded by government grants, scholarships, loans. The primary grant program is Pell grants.Student loans come in several varieties, but are basically either federal loans or private student loans. Federal loans are either subsidized (the government pays the interest) and unsubsidized. Federal student loans are subsidized for undergraduates only. Subsidized loans generally defer payments and interest until some period (usually six months) after the student has left school. Some states have their own loan programs, as do some colleges. In almost all cases, these student loans have better conditions than private loans.Student loans may be used for college-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers, and transportation.\\n\\nDemographics\\nApproximately 30% of all college students do not borrow. In 2019, the average undergraduate who had taken on debt had a loan balance of about $30,000 upon graduation. Almost half of the student loans are for graduate education, and those loan amounts are typically much higher.:\\u200a1\\n\\nSocial class\\nAccording to the Saint Louis Federal Reserve Bank, \"existing racial wealth disparities and soaring higher education costs may replicate racial wealth disparities across generations by driving racial disparities in student loan debt load and repayment.\"Low-income students often prefer grants and scholarships over loans because of their difficulty repaying them. In 2004, 88.5% of Pell Grant recipients who had bachelor\\'s degrees graduated with student loan debt. After college, students struggle to break into a higher income bracket because of the loans they owe. Though, it\\'s been shown that when it comes to student loan forgiveness and advocacy around this issue, lower-socioeconomic groups are the ones most motivated to contact their legislators about student loans. In 1995, 64 percent of students whose family incomes falling below $35,000 were contacting their legislators concerning student loans.\\n\\nRace and gender\\nAccording to the New York Times, \"recent black graduates of four-year colleges owe, on average, $7,400 more than their white peers. Four years after graduation, they still owe an average of $53,000, almost twice as much as whites.\"According to an analysis by Demos, 12 years after entering college:\\n\\nWhite men paid off 44 percent of their student-loan balance\\nWhite women paid off 28 percent\\nBlack men saw their balances grow 11 percent\\nBlack women saw their loan balances grow 13 percent\\n\\nAge\\nAccording to a CNBC analysis, the highest student debt balances are carried by adults aged 25–49, with the lowest debt loads held by those aged 62 and older.As of 2021, approximately 7.8 million Americans from 18 to 25 carry student loan debt, with an average balance of almost $15,000. For adults between the ages of 35 and 49, the average individual balance owed exceeded $42,000. The average debt for adults between 50 and 61 is slightly lower. These balances include loans for their education and their children.\\n\\nFederal loans\\nLoans to students\\nStafford and Perkins loans were federal loans made to students. These loans did not consider credit history (most students have no credit history); approval was automatic if the student met program requirements. Nearly all students are eligible to receive federal loans.\\n\\nPayment/discharge\\nThe student makes no payments while enrolled at least half-time. If a student drops below half time or graduates, a six-month deferment begins. If the student returns to least half-time status, the loans are again deferred, but a second episode no longer qualifies and repayment must begin. All Perkins loans and some undergraduate Stafford loans are subsidized. Loan amounts are limited.\\nMany deferment and forbearance options are offered in the Federal Direct Student Loan program.Disabled borrowers have the possibility of discharge. Other discharge provisions are available for teachers in specific critical subjects or in a school that has more than 30% of its students on reduced-price lunch. They qualify for discharge of Stafford, Perkins, and Federal Family Education Loan Program loans up to $77,500.Any person employed full-time by a 501(c)(3) non-profit group, or another qualifying public service organization, or serving in a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps position, qualifies for discharge after 120 qualifying payments. However, loan discharge is considered taxable income. Loans discharged that were not the result of long-term public service employment constitute taxable income.\\nStudent loan borrowers may have their existing federal student loan debt removed if they can prove that their school misled them. The program is called Borrower Defense to Repayment or Borrower Defense.Subsidies are conditional depending on financial need. Pricing and loan limits are determined by Congress. Undergraduates typically receive lower interest rates, while graduate students typically can borrow more. Disregarding risk has been criticized as contributing to inefficiency. Financial needs may vary from school to school. The government covers interest charges while the student is in college. For example, those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 upon graduation.\\n\\nTerms\\nLoans are guaranteed by DOE, either directly or through guarantee agencies.\\nThe dependent undergraduate limits are $5,500 per year for freshman undergraduates, $6,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $7,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduates, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or coursework preparatory for graduate programs.For independent undergraduates, the limits are $9,500 per year for freshmen, $10,500 for sophomores, and $12,500 per year for juniors and seniors, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs.\\nUnsubsidized loans are also guaranteed, but interest accrues during study. Nearly all students are eligible for these loans regardless of financial need. Those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 plus interest upon graduation. Accrued interest is added to the loan amount, and the borrower makes payments on the total. Students can make payments while studying.\\nGraduate students have higher limits: $8,500 for subsidized Stafford and $12,500 (varying by course of study) for unsubsidized Stafford. For graduate students, the Perkins limit is $6,000 per year.\\n\\nStafford loan aggregate limits\\nStafford borrowers cannot exceed aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For dependent undergraduates, the aggregate limit is $57,500, while subsidized loans are limited to $23,000. Students who reach the maximum in subsidized loans may (based on grade level—undergraduate, graduate/professional, etc.) add a loan of less than or equal to the amount they would have been eligible for in subsidized loans. Once aggregate limits are met, the student is ineligible for additional Stafford loans until they pay back a portion of the borrowed funds. A student who has paid back some of these amounts regains eligibility up to the aggregate limits as before. Graduate students have a lifetime aggregate loan limit of $138,500.\\n\\nDebt statistics\\nDirect loans ($1.15 trillion, 34.2 million borrowers)\\nFFEL loans ($281.8 billion, 13.5 million borrowers). The program ended in 2010.\\nPerkins loans ($7.1 billion, 2.3 million borrowers). The program ended in 2018.\\nTotal ($1.4392 trillion, 42.9 million borrowers)\\n\\nLoans to parents\\nPLUS loans are federal education loans made to parents. These have much higher loan limits, usually enough to cover costs that exceed student financial aid. Payments start immediately after education ends, although prepayment is allowed. Credit history is considered; thus, approval is not automatic.\\nInterest accrues during the time the student is in school. PLUS interest rates as of 2017 were 7%.The parents are personally responsible for repayment. The parents sign the master promissory note and are accountable. Parents are advised to consider their monthly payments. Loan documents reflect the repayment schedule for a single year. Since most students borrow again each year, the ultimate payments are much higher. PLUS loans consider credit history, making it more difficult for low-income parents to qualify.\\nGraduate students are eligible to receive PLUS loans in their own names. Graduate PLUS loans have the same interest rates and terms as those to parents.\\nFederal Direct Student Loans, also known as Direct Loans or FDLP loans, originate with the United States Treasury. FDLP loans are distributed by the DOE, then to the college or university and then to the student.\\n\\nDebt levels\\nLoan limits are below the cost of most four-year private institutions and most public universities. Students add private student loans to make up the difference.The maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change.\\n\\nDefaults\\nOut of 100 students who ever attended a for-profit institution, 23 defaulted in the 1996 cohort compared to 43 in the 2004 cohort (compared to an increase from 8 to 11 among borrowers who never attended a for-profit).As of 2018 black BA graduates defaulted at five times the rate of white BA graduates (21 versus 4 percent), and were more likely to default than white dropouts.\\n\\nPrivate loans\\nPrivate loans are offered by banks or finance companies. They are not guaranteed by a government agency. Private loans cost more, offer less favorable terms, and are generally used only when students have exhausted the federal borrowing limit. They are not eligible for Income-Based Repayment plans, and frequently have less flexible payment terms, higher fees, and more penalties, than federal student loans. Private loans may be difficult to discharge through bankruptcy.Private loans are made to students or parents. They have higher limits and no payments until after education, although interest starts to accrue immediately and the deferred interest is added to the principal. Interest rates are higher on federal loans, which are set by the United States Congress.The advantage of private student loans is that they do not include loan or total debt limits. They typically offer a no-payment grace period of six months (occasionally 12 months).\\nMost experts recommend private loans only as a last resort, because of the less favorable terms.\\n\\nLoan types\\nPrivate student loans generally come in two types: school-channel and direct-to-consumer.\\nSchool-channel loans offer borrowers lower interest rates, but generally take longer to process. These loans are \"certified\" by the school, which means the school signs off on the borrowing amount, and the funds are disbursed directly to the school. The \"certification\" means only that the school confirms the loan funds will be used for educational expenses only and agrees to hold them and disburse them as needed. Certification does not mean that the school approves of, recommends, or has even examined the loan terms.\\nDirect-to-consumer private loans do not involve the school. The student supplies enrollment verification to the lender, and the loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the student. While direct-to-consumer loans generally carry higher interest rates than school-channel loans, they allow families access to funds more quickly — in some cases, in a matter of days. This convenience comes at the risk of student over-borrowing and/or use of funds for inappropriate purposes.Loan providers range from large education finance companies to speciality companies that focus exclusively on this niche.\\n\\nInterest rates\\nPrivate student loans usually have substantially higher interest rates, and the rates fluctuate depending on the financial markets. Some private loans require substantial up-front origination fees (\"points\") along with lower interest rates. Interest rates also vary depending on the applicant\\'s credit history.\\nMost private loan programs are tied to financial indexes such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller loan origination fees than those with poorer credit histories. Interest payments are tax deductible.\\nLenders rarely give complete details of loan terms until after an application is submitted. Many lenders advertise only the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with damaged credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, loan fees that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than those advertised figures.\\n\\nLoan fees\\nPrivate loans often carry an origination fee, which can be substantial. Origination fees are a one-time charge based on the amount of the loan. They can be paid from the loan proceeds or from personal funds independent of the loan amount, often at the borrower\\'s preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans. The origination fee gets paid once, while interest is paid throughout the loan. The loan amount accumulates to about 15 billion borrowed from private loans.All lenders are legally required to provide a statement of the annual percentage rate (APR) prior to closure. Unlike the \"base\" rate, this rate includes any fees charged and can be thought of as the \"effective\" interest rate including interest, fees, etc. When comparing loans, comparing APR rather than \"rate\" ensures a valid comparison for loans that have the same repayment term. However, if the repayment terms are different, APR becomes a less-perfect comparison tool. In those circumstances comparing total financing costs may be more appropriate.\\n\\nLoan terms\\nIn contrast with federal loans, whose terms are standardized, private loan terms vary from loan to loan. However, it is not easy to compare them, as some conditions may not be revealed until signing. A common suggestion is to consider all terms, not just respond to advertised interest rates. Applying to multiple lenders (to create a comparison) can damage the borrower\\'s credit score. Examples of other terms  that vary by lender are deferments (amount of time after leaving school before payments start) and forbearances (a period when payments are temporarily stopped due to financial or other hardship).\\n\\nCosigners\\nPrivate student loan programs generally issue loans based on the credit history of the applicant and any applicable cosigner, co-endorser or coborrower. Students may find that their families have too much income or too many assets to qualify for federal aid, but lack sufficient assets and income to pay for school without assistance. Most students need a cosigner in order to qualify for a private loan.Many international students can obtain private loans (they are usually ineligible for federal loans) with a cosigner who is a citizen or permanent resident. However, some graduate programs (notably top MBA programs) partner with private loan providers. In those cases, no cosigner is needed for international students.\\n\\nLoan servicers\\nThe U.S. Department of Education contracts with companies to manage, or service, the loans it owns. These companies are the primary point of contact for borrowers after they graduate and enter repayment.\\nAs of July 2023, the four companies which service the majority of student loans are Aidvantage, EdFinancial Services, MOHELA (Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri) and Nelnet. ECSI (Educational Computer Systems, Inc.) is the exclusive servicer for the remaining Perkins Loans. Borrowers who have defaulted on loans are assigned to the Department of Education’s Default Resolution Group for servicing.\\n\\nStudent loan asset-backed securities (SLABS)\\nFFELP and private loans are bundled, securitized, rated, then sold to institutional investors as student loan asset-backed securities (SLABS). Navient and Nelnet are two major private lenders. Wells Fargo Bank, JP MorganChase, Goldman Sachs and other large banks package and sell SLABS in bundles. Moody\\'s, Fitch Ratings, and Standard and Poor\\'s rate SLAB quality.The Asset-Backed Security (ABS) industry received financial relief in 2008 and in 2020 through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) program, which was created to preserve the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, including student loans. In 2020, critics argued that the SLAB market was poorly regulated and could be headed toward a significant downturn, despite perceptions that it was low risk.\\n\\nRepayment and default\\nMetrics\\nThe industry metrics are repayment rate and default rate, such as the one-, three-, five-, and seven-year default rates. DOE\\'s College Scorecard includes the following repayment statuses:\\n\\nMaking Progress\\nForbearance\\nDeferment\\nNot Making Progress\\nDelinquent\\nDefaulted\\nPaid In Full\\nDischarged\\n\\nRepayment rate\\nThe three-year repayment rate for each school that receives Title IV funding is available at DOE\\'s College Scorecard. This number may be a poor indicator of the overall default rate: some schools place loans into forbearance, deferring loans beyond the three-year window to present a low default rate.\\n\\nDefault rate\\nThe default rate for borrowers who did not complete their degree is three times as high as the rate for those who did.:\\u200a1\\n\\nStandard repayment\\nFederal loans are initially designated as standard repayment. Standard repayment borrowers have 10 years to repay. The loan servicer calculates the monthly payment amount that will pay off the original loan amount plus all accrued interest after 120 equal payments.\\nPayments cover interest and part of the principal. Some loan terms may be shorter than 10 years. The minimum monthly payment is  $50.\\n\\nIncome-related repayment\\nIncome-based repayment\\nIf loan debt is high but income is modest or zero, borrowers may qualify for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Most major types of federal student loans—except for PLUS loans for parents—are eligible. IDRs allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments at 10%, 15%, or 20% of disposable income for up to 20 or 25 years, after which the remaining balance is forgiven.Four IDRs are available:\\n\\nIncome-Based Repayment (IBR)\\nPay As You Earn (PAYE)\\nRevised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)\\nIncome-Contingent Repayment (ICR)\\n\\nIncome share agreements\\nAn income share agreement is an alternative to a traditional loan. The borrower agrees to pay a percentage of their salary to the educational institution after graduation. Purdue University offers income share agreements.\\n\\nDefenses to repayment\\nUnder some circumstances, debt can be cancelled. For example, students who attended a school when it closed or the student was enrolled based on false claims may be able to escape repayment.\\n\\nLeaving the country to evade repayment\\nDebt evasion is the intentional act of trying to avoid attempts by creditors to collect a debt. News accounts report that some individuals are departing the US to escape their debt. Emigration does not discharge the loan or stop interest and penalties from accruing.\\nInternational addresses make it more difficult to find people, and collection companies would usually need to hire an international counsel or a third party collector to recoup the debt, cutting into their profits and reducing their incentive to go after a debtor.  \\'It increases our expenses to go overseas,\\' says Justin Berg of American Profit Recovery, a debt collection agency in Massachusetts. \\'Our revenues are cut by more than half,\\' he says.\"\\nNations may enter into agreements with the US to facilitate the collection of student loans.After default, co-signers remain liable for repayment.\\n\\nBankruptcy\\nFederal loans and some private loans can be discharged in bankruptcy by demonstrating that the loan does not meet the requirements of section 523(a)(8) of the bankruptcy code or by showing that repayment of the loan would constitute \"undue hardship\". While credit card debt often can be discharged through bankruptcy proceedings, this option is not generally available for federally subsidize or insured student loans. Unless the loan can be proven not to be an educational benefit, those seeking to discharge their debt must initiate an adversary proceeding, a separate lawsuit within the bankruptcy case where they illustrate the required hardship. Many borrowers cannot afford the costs to retain an attorney or litigation costs associated with an adversary proceeding, such as a bankruptcy case. The undue hardship standard varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but is generally difficult to meet. In most circuit courts discharge depends on meeting the three prongs in the Brunner test: As noted by the district court, there is very little appellate authority on the definition of \"undue hardship\" in the context of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8)(B). Based on legislative history and the decisions of other district and bankruptcy courts, the district court adopted a standard for \"undue hardship\" requiring a three-part showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \"minimal\" standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans. For the reasons set forth in the district court\\'s order, we adopt this analysis. The first part of this test has been applied frequently as the minimum necessary to establish \"undue hardship.\" See, e.g., Bryant v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Bryant), 72 B.R. 913, 915 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1987); North Dakota State Bd. of Higher Educ. v. Frech (In re Frech), 62 B.R. 235 (Bankr.D.Minn.1986); Marion v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Marion), 61 B.R. 815 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1986). Requiring such a showing comports with common sense as well.\\nFederal student loans may be eligible for administrative discharge. Those provisions do not apply to private loans, although private loans may be subject to discharge in bankruptcy. One study found that a quarter million student debtors file for bankruptcy each year. Approximately 450 attempted to seek a discharge in 2017 by arguing that their loan was not an \"educational benefit\" as defined by section 523(a)(8), or they successfully argued for \"undue hardship\". Of the completed cases, more than 60% were able to discharge their debts or achieve a settlement. The study concluded that the data showed: Creditors are settling unfavorable cases to avoid adverse precedent and litigating good cases to cultivate favorable precedent. Ultimately, this litigation strategy has distorted the law and cultivated the myth of nondischargeability.The study found that debtors who obtain favorable outcomes do not possess unique characteristics differentiating them from those who do not seek discharge and estimates that 64,000 individuals who filed for bankruptcy in 2019 would have met the hardship standard. It concluded about half of all bankrupt debtors could obtain relief, except that they had become convinced that loans were not dischargeable.For disabled debtors the standard is whether \"substantial gainful activity\" (SGA) is still possible Borrowers determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration, are eligible if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle. Debt discharged due to death or total permanent disability is nontaxable.In three circuit court jurisdictions private student loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy.\\n\\nCriticisms\\nSchool effects\\nSome critics of financial aid in general claim that it allows schools to raise their fees, to accept unprepared students, and to produce too many graduates in some fields of study.In 1987, then-Secretary of Education William Bennett argued that “... increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise tuition, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.” This statement came to be known as the “Bennett Hypothesis”.\\nIn July 2015, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report concluded that institutions more exposed to increases in student loan program maximums tended to respond with disproportionate tuition increases. Pell Grant, subsidized, and unsubsidized loans led to increases of about 40, 60, and 15 cents on the dollar, respectively. In the 20 years between 1987 and 2007, tuition costs rose 326%. Public universities increased their fees by 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, while out-of-state students paid more than $19,000. For the two decades ending in 2013, college costs rose 1.6% more than inflation each year. By contrast, government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012.Many students cannot get loans or determine that the cost of going to school is not worth the debt, believing that they would still be unable to make enough income to pay it back.Some universities steered borrowers to preferred lenders that charged higher interest rates. Some of these lenders allegedly paid kick backs to university financial aid staff. After the behavior became public, many universities rebated fees to affected borrowers.\\n\\nInterest rates\\nThe federal student loan program was criticized for not adjusting interest rates according to factors under students\\' control, such as the choice of academic major. Critics have contended that flat-rate pricing contributes to inefficiency and misallocation of resources in higher education and lower productivity in the labor market. However, one study found that high debt and default levels do not burden society substantially.\\n\\nBankruptcy\\nIn 2009 student loans\\' non-dischargeability was claimed to provide a credit risk-free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.\\n\\nLong-term debt and default\\nAbout one-third of borrowers never pay off their loans. Those who default shift their burden to taxpayers.According to Harvard Business School researchers, \"when student debt is erased, a huge burden is lifted and people take big steps to improve their lives: They seek higher-paying careers in new states, improve their education, get their other finances in order, and make more substantial contributions to the economy.\"\\n\\nSallie Mae and Nelnet\\nSallie Mae and Nelnet are the largest lenders and are frequently defendants in lawsuits. The False Claims Suit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former DOE researcher Dr. Jon Oberg against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the United States Government and defrauded taxpayers of over $22 million. In August 2010, Nelnet settled and paid $55 million. Ultimately seven lenders returned taxpayer funds as a result of his lawsuits.\\n\\nSchool quality\\nIn April 2019, Brookings Institution fellow Adam Looney, a long-time analyst of student loans, claimed that:\"It is an outrage that the federal government offers loans to students at low-quality institutions even when we know those schools don’t boost their earnings and that those borrowers won’t be able to repay their loans. It is an outrage that we make parent PLUS loans to the poorest families when we know they almost surely will default and have their wages and social security benefits garnished and their tax refunds confiscated, as $2.8 billion was in 2017. It is an outrage that we saddled several million students with loans to enroll in untested online programs that seem to have offered no labor market value. It is an outrage that our lending programs encourage schools like USC to charge $107,484 (and students to blithely enroll) for a master’s degree in social work (220 percent more than the equivalent course at UCLA) in a field where the median wage is $47,980. It’s no wonder many borrowers feel their student loans led to economic catastrophe.\"\\n\\nPotential consequences of student loan debt\\nWhile college grads earn about 70% more than people with only a high school degree, student loan debt has been associated with several social, economic, and psychological consequences, including:\\nhaving to choose less satisfying work that pays more, lower credit ratings from missed payments that may disqualify borrowers from work opportunities given poor payment history, reduced wealth accumulation, reduced housing access, delayed marriage, delayed childbirth, decreased retirement security and increased anxiety.\\n\\nReform proposals\\nOrganizations that advocate for student loan reform include the Debt Collective and Student Loan Justice.Some pundits proposed that colleges share liability on defaulted student loans.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) introduced legislation in 2017 to \"make public colleges and universities tuition-free for working families and to significantly reduce student debt.\" The policy would eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities, lower interest rates, and allow those with existing debt to refinance. Sanders offered a new proposal in 2019 that would cancel $1.6 trillion of student loan, undergraduate and graduate debt for around 45 million Americans.Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) reintroduced the Debt Free College Act in 2019.In 2020, a majority of economists surveyed by the Initiative on Global Markets felt that forgiving all student loans would be more beneficial to higher income earners than lower income earners.During the 2020 presidential election, then-candidate Joe Biden said he planned to allow $10,000 in debt forgiveness to all student debtors. On August 24, 2022, Biden announced that he would forgive an amount of $10,000 for an estimated 43 million borrowers, and an additional $10,000 for Pell Grant recipients, with this relief limited to singles earning under $125,000 and married couples earning under $250,000, including refunding payments during the forbearance period by any borrower who requests it. This would reduce debt for an estimated 43 million borrowers and eliminate student loan debt for an estimated 20 million.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost the government about $400 billion. The administration also proposed a new income-driven repayment plan. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 30, 2023 that Biden\\'s plan required action by Congress and that the HEROES Act did not permit the administration to act on its own.Some borrowers still have loans issued under the Federal Family Education Loan Program which closed in 2010. The Biden forgiveness plan originally allowed these borrowers to receive forgiveness by consolidating into Direct Loans, but due to potential lawsuits stopped allowing this on September 29, 2022, potentially excluding 800,000 FFEL borrowers.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Student Loan Marketing Association was originally created in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and began privatizing its operations in 1997, a process it completed at the end of 2004 when Congress terminated its federal charter, ending its ties to the government. The company provides private education loans for students and their families. These loans are not made, insured, or guaranteed by any state or federal government.In 2005, Sallie Mae was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.In August 2006, Sallie Mae acquired Upromise, a company that provides rebates to buyers of certain brands, which can be applied to college savings accounts. In May 2020, Upromise was acquired by loyalty marketing company Prodege.On April 16, 2007, Sallie Mae announced that an investor group led by J.C. Flowers & Co. signed an agreement to purchase Sallie Mae for approximately $25 billion. Had the transaction been completed, J.C. Flowers, along with private-equity firm Friedman Fleischer & Lowe would have owned 50.2% of Sallie Mae, and Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase would each have owned 24.9%.  Sallie Mae would have ceased to be a publicly traded company. The deal fell through in September 2007, with the buyers blaming adverse changes to the business\\'s outlook as a result of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 and the tightening of global credit markets following the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.  Sallie Mae subsequently began legal action, only to drop it in January 2008 upon completion of a $31 billion funding round, including funding from Bank of America.On April 6, 2009, Sallie Mae announced that it would move 2,000 jobs back to the U.S. within the next 18 months as it shifts call center and other operations from overseas.On March 31, 2010, Sallie Mae announced the impending layoff of 2,500 employees in response to the signing of new legislation calling for the federal government to lend directly to students, bypassing institutions like Sallie Mae.On July 1, 2010, Sallie Mae announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Reston, Virginia, to its existing facility in Newark, Delaware.On September 17, 2010, Sallie Mae acquired federally insured loans from Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation worth $28 billion.SLM Corporation, the company that operates Sallie Mae, was formed in 2013. On February 25, 2014, Sallie Mae announced the launch of Navient, a separate entity for federal student loan servicing. On April 30, Sallie Mae legally separated from Navient, and made its primary focus private student loans, banking products, and credit cards for college students and their families.In March 2020, the company announced Jonathan Witter, former Hilton executive, would replace Raymond Quinlan as the new CEO.Sallie Mae announced a partnership with Mpower Financing in April 2021, to expand access to higher education for international and DACA students.\\n\\nCorporate information\\nThe Sallie Mae corporate headquarters is in Newark, Delaware. Sallie Mae also operates offices in New Castle, Delaware; Newton, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Sterling, Virginia.\\n\\nCorporate board\\nAlbert Lord held the positions of vice chairman and CEO until his retirement 2013. Lord joined Sallie Mae in 1981, took over as CEO in 1995, and led the company\\'s privatization. On May 29, 2013, the board announced Jack Remondi as Lord\\'s successor.Carter Franke is the current chair of Sallie Mae\\'s board of directors, since her appointment in June 2020. Prior to Franke, Raymond J. Quinlan served in the role, having joined the board in 2014 to replace previous chairman Anthony P. Terracciano—formerly president of First Union Corporation (now Wells Fargo).  Quinlan was also the chief executive office of Sallie Mae from May 2014 until March 2020, when current CEO Jonathan Witter assumed the position.\\n\\nAwards\\nThrough The Fund\\'s work, Sallie Mae was named among BusinessWeek\\'s Top 15 Corporate Philanthropists in 2004. The Washington Business Journal identified the company as the top local corporate philanthropist in 2005.In the early 2010s, Kiplinger\\'s Personal Finance recognized Sallie Mae Bank as the Best Online Savings Account, the Best Money Market Account. “the best place to stash cash,” and the Best Savings Account.\\n\\nControversies\\nA 60 Minutes segment (originally aired May 7, 2006) examined Sallie Mae, including its business practices. Senator Elizabeth Warren, then a professor at Harvard Law School and sharp critic of what she characterizes as unfair lending practices, questioned Sallie Mae\\'s dual role as lender and collector of student loans.In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae. On April 11, 2007, Cuomo ended his investigation of Sallie Mae and announced that Sallie Mae had voluntarily agreed to change its lending standards to satisfy a new code of conduct for student loan practices established by Cuomo, and to donate $2 million (USD) to a fund devoted to educating college-bound students about their loan options.On October 10, 2007, documents surfaced showing that Sallie Mae was attempting to use the Freedom of Information Act to force colleges to turn over students\\' personal information. The university involved, the State University of New York system, was expected to decline the request and be forced to defend its position in court.\\nIn December 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought against Sallie Mae in a Connecticut federal court alleging that the company discriminated against African American and Hispanic private student loan applicants by charging them high interest rates and fees. The lawsuit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose private student loan terms to unsuspecting students. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, raised similar concerns about possible student loan redlining in June 2007. The lawsuit was settled and dismissed in 2011. Under the terms of the settlement, Sallie Mae agreed to make a $500,000 donation to the United Negro College Fund and the attorneys for the plaintiffs received $1.8 million in attorneys\\' fees.On January 31, 2008, SLM Corporation paid $35,000,000 to settle a lawsuit for failing to adequately reserve for losses in Sallie Mae\\'s non-traditional portfolio.A False Claims suit was filed against Sallie Mae by former U.S. Department of Education researcher, Dr. Oberg, in 2009. The suit alleges that Sallie Mae and other lenders deliberately overcharged the U.S. government. The findings by Oberg were labeled among higher education policy analysts as the 9.5 scandal.On February 20, 2014, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office announced that an investigation into Sallie Mae\\'s debt collection practices and loan servicing practices had been opened.On November 9, 2005, former Sallie Mae employee Michael Zahara filed a federal lawsuit against the company, alleging that it had a pattern and practice of granting forbearance in a purposeful effort to increase total student loan debt. On October 29, 2008, permission was granted to his legal counsel to withdraw from the case, citing \"From counsel’s perspective, a breakdown in trust has resulted from the discovery that Relator has been arrested for extortion, the circumstances surrounding that arrest, and Relator’s failure to disclose the arrest to counsel.\" On March 12, 2009, the court ruled \"dismissal without prejudice\" because \"the plaintiff has failed to obtain substitute counsel by the deadline.\"\\n\\nSubsidiaries\\nSallie Mae Bank\\nSLM Financial Corporation\\n\\nQualifying employers\\nGovernment organizations or agencies (federal, state or local), 501(c)(3) organizations as defined by the IRS, and some other types of not-for-profit organizations providing designated public services qualify for PSLF.\\nThe nature of the individual\\'s job responsibilities is not a determining factor in whether the employment qualifies. Rather, only the employer\\'s status as a qualifying employer determines whether the employment qualifies.\\nWith limited exception, the individual must be directly employed by the qualifying employer. Therefore, government contractors will not qualify on the basis of their government contracts. Instead, they must independently be a qualifying employer. Another example is the national labs. Employees at national labs such as a Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration Lab, do not qualify on the basis of managing a lab for the government; rather, the managing entity of the lab must be a qualifying employer.\\n\\nEligible loans\\nAny loan made under the Direct Loan Program can qualify for PSLF. In particular, Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans qualify for PSLF. \\nLoans in the FFEL program or Federal Perkins Loans can be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan to become eligible for the program. Private student loans are ineligible to be consolidated into a Direct Loan and thus cannot be discharged under the PSLF program.\\n\\nQualifying for forgiveness\\nAn individual qualifies for PSLF after making 120 on-time, monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. After the borrower has made 120 qualifying payments, any remaining balance of the borrower’s eligible student loan is forgiven without any tax implications. Currently, there is no cap as to the amount of forgiveness a borrower can receive.  \\nThose interested in receiving PSLF should regularly submit the \"Employment Certification Form\" for PSLF. This form will be used by the Department of Education\\'s contractor, Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (MOHELA) , (formerly FedLoan Servicing), to determine whether an individual\\'s employment and payments qualify for the program.\\n\\nQualifying payment plans\\nMultiple plans are available to those interested in the PSLF program. Those wishing to seek forgiveness under the PSLF should make payments under one of the income-driven repayment plans, including Income Contingent Repayment, Income Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, or Revised Pay As You Earn.\\nOn May 23, 2018, the U.S. Department of Education announced a second-chance plan for people in public service jobs who were denied loan forgiveness because they chose the wrong repayment plan. The DoED will use $350 million set aside by Congress in a fix-it fund to help people seeking reconsideration. The money will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.\\n\\nProblems with the program\\nThe earliest date that public servants could qualify for full cancelation of their loans was October 1, 2017, ten years after PSLF existed. Problems soon emerged. Of the first 28,000 public servants who applied for forgiveness, only 96 were approved. This is a denial rate of 99 percent. In March 2018 Congress attempted to fix PSLF by passing the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (TEPSLF). According to a Government Accountability Office report of the 54,184 who applied for TEPSLF 53,523 got denied. These denials are the result of many problems, including servicers who provided false or misleading information about whether an account had the right loan type and payment plan to qualify for PSLF. On October 6, 2021, the Biden administration announced a temporary waiver allowing past payments to qualify even if they had the wrong loan type or payment plan. As of March 2022 100,000 people have had over $6.2 billion of student loans canceled as a result of the waiver, however, many problems still persist. The government estimates that 1.3 million public servants qualify for PSLF. FedLoan Servicing continues to incorrectly tell people that they do not qualify for PSLF when in fact they do. FedLoan has also been sending automated messages with inaccurate payment counts. The CFPB has issued a warning to FedLoan. The Department of Education\\'s PSLF help tool will not allow people to select that they have made over 120 payments, forcing people to fill out the form with inaccurate information or find workarounds. Applicants who have reached 120 qualified payments have reported long processing delays of three months or more after submitting PSLF forms to loan servicer, Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri.\\n\\nFuture reduction proposals\\nFor his 2015 budget proposal to Congress, President Barack Obama proposed capping Public Service Loan Forgiveness at $57,500 for all new borrowers. Analysis at the website Educated Risk, however, details the difficulty of modifying PSLF:The 2016 Republican budget resolution proposed to eliminate the PSLF program to all new student loan borrowers. A recent GAO report found that the cost of loan forgiveness has been underestimated, leading many commentators to speculate that a new Republican administration and Congress will take steps to curb the problem.President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the PSLF in his 2018 budget proposal. Similarly, the Republican-proposed PROSPER Act would have eliminated the PSLF. Any changes would have only applied to new borrowers as of July 1, 2019. The PROSPER Act is considered \"dead\" with Democrats retaking control of the House of Representatives in 2019.President Trump\\'s 2019 budget proposed eliminating the PSLF. The elimination would have only affected new borrowers as of July 1, 2020. Trump\\'s 2021 fiscal budget made a similar proposal that would only apply to new borrowers.\\n\\nContradictory claims by the government regarding eligibility and litigation\\nIn December 2016, it was reported that some employees who had been previously told by the government that their jobs were eligible for the program were later told that their jobs were not eligible. In response, the American Bar Association joined four individual plaintiffs who were denied eligibility under PSLF in a lawsuit against the United States Department of Education to stop the Department’s decision to retroactively refuse to honor loan forgiveness commitments it made to individuals who \"have dedicated their careers to public service.\" The ABA argued the Department of Education \"substantially changed its policy on PSLF-eligible employers\" which directly contradicts statutory procedures for modifying regulations requiring public notice and comment periods. On February 22, 2019, a New York federal district court found the Department of Education\\'s actions \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The Court found: \"In adopting the new standards, the Department failed to display awareness of its changed position, provide a reasoned analysis for that decision and take into account the serious reliance interests affected.\" The Court vacated the Department\\'s denial letters and remanded the matters to the Department of Education for reconsideration. Such ruling could lay the groundwork for borrowers who were denied loan forgiveness after being told they were eligible to appeal. The court classified the department\\'s position as \"nonsense\". The Department elected not to appeal the ruling. The Department of Education subsequently stated that all full-time ABA employees are employed in \"a public service job\" for a \"public service organization\" as part of a settlement between the ABA and the Department. The Education Department further stated that its decision does not restrict the agency from changing the definition of a public service organization in new regulations in the future.\\n\\n\\nA Stafford Loan was a student loan offered from the United States Department of Education  to eligible students enrolled in accredited American institutions of higher education to help finance their education. The terms of the loans are described in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (with subsequent amendments), which guarantees repayment to the lender if a student defaults. As of July 1, 2010, Stafford Loans are no longer being offered, having been replaced with the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program.\\nIn 1988, Congress renamed the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan program the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan program, in honor of U.S. Senator Robert Stafford, a Republican from Vermont, for his work on higher education.Stafford loans were guaranteed by the full faith of the US government, and were offered at a lower interest rate than the borrower would otherwise be able to get for a private loan. On the other hand, there were strict eligibility requirements and borrowing limits on Stafford Loans.\\nAs with other types of federal financial aid, students who applied for a Stafford Loan were required to complete a FAFSA. While the student was enrolled for at least half-time they were not expected to pay any principal payments on the loan, a status referred to as in-school deferment. Deferment of repayment continued for six months after the student leaves school by graduating, dropping below half-time enrollment, or withdrawing, referred to as the grace period.\\nStafford Loans were available both as subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans are offered to students based on demonstrated financial need (see Expected Family Contribution). The interest on subsidized loans is paid by the federal government while the student is in school and during authorized deferment. For unsubsidized Stafford Loans, students are responsible for all of the interest that accrues while the student is enrolled in school. The interest may be deferred throughout enrollment. Unpaid interest that is deferred until after graduation is capitalized (added to the loan principal).\\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated subsidized Stafford loans for graduate and professional students effective July 1, 2012. Unsubsidized Stafford loans are still available to these students.\\n\\nInterest rates\\nInterest rates on Stafford Loans may vary and are determined based upon the date the loan was disbursed. They may also vary by the education level (undergraduate or graduate) of the student.  Interest rates do not vary with default risk: all students receive the same interest rate regardless of their major or their future employment prospects.For variable rate loans, the rates are set annually using the price of the 91-day Treasury bill on the last Monday of May, and become effective for the following year on July 1. For fiscal year 2008–2009, the 91-day Treasury bill auctioned on May 27, 2008, at 1.905% (rounded to 1.91%) was used for the calculation.  On May 26, 2009, the 91-day Treasury bill was auctioned at an investment rate of 0.178%. On July 1, 2009, the base rate for variable rate Stafford Loans were adjusted to 0.18%. Loans issued before July 1, 1998, were adjusted to a rate of 3.28%.  Loans issued between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 2006, were adjusted to a rate of 2.48%.\\nOn August 9, 2013, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, changing how student loan interest rates are determined. The bill links student loan rates to the Federal 10-year Treasury rate, plus a small margin. The new rates are retroactive for all loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013. That effectively reversed an increase in interest rate from 3.40% to 6.80% for affected loans. Federal student loan interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan; however, the rates for new loans will change annually, based on the current market. The interest rates for the 2013–2014 academic year are as follows: 3.86% for undergraduate Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) 5.41% for graduate Stafford Loans\\n\\n\\nFinancial Aid at Curlie\\nA Federal Perkins Loan, or Perkins Loan, was a need-based student loan part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, offered by the U.S. Department of Education to assist American college students in funding their post-secondary education.  The program was named after Carl D. Perkins, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Kentucky.\\nPerkins Loans carried a fixed interest rate of 5% for the duration of the ten-year repayment period. The Perkins Loan Program had a nine-month grace period, so that borrowers began repayment in the tenth month upon graduating, falling below half-time status, or withdrawing from their college or university. Since the Perkins Loan was subsidized by the government, interest did not begin to accrue until the borrower began to repay the loan. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the loan limits for undergraduates were $5,500 per year with a lifetime maximum loan of $27,500.  For graduate students, the limit was $8,000 per year with a lifetime limit of $60,000 (including undergraduate loans).\\nPerkins Loans were eligible for Federal Loan Cancellation for individuals choosing to work in a number of different public service occupations including early childhood education, elementary and secondary school teaching, speech therapy, nursing, law enforcement, librarian, public defense attorney, fire fighting and certain active duty military postings.  Depending on the field of employment, further restrictions on the setting of employment may apply.  For example, forgiveness for teachers may be restricted to designated low-income schools or specific teacher shortage areas such as math, science, and bilingual education and forgiveness for nurses requires employment at a non-profit medical facility. A percentage of the loan was cancelled for each year spent teaching full-time (as long as the loan remains in good standing). This cancellation also applies to Peace Corps Volunteers.  Cancellation typically occurs on a graduating scale: 15% for year 1, 15% for year 2, 20% for year 3, 20% for year 4, 30% for year 5.  These percentages were based on the original debt amount.  Thus after 3 years of service, one would have 50% of their original debt cancelled.On September 30, 2017, the Federal Perkins Loan program failed to renew in Congress, thus effectively ending the loan program.\\n\\n\\nSimilarities with Stafford and Perkins loans\\nPLUS loans share some similarities with the Stafford and Perkins loans offered to students:\\nOffered under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (with subsequent amendments) and are therefore backed by the full faith of the United States Government\\nCan be consolidated through the federal student loan consolidation program\\n\\nDifferences from Stafford and Perkins loans\\nThere are no limits on the amount borrowed up to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid. Living expenses are considered part of the cost of attendance.\\nThe repayment schedule for Direct PLUS Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 is the same as the schedule for Stafford loans. However, for Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed before July 1, 2008, the repayment period begins at the time the PLUS loan is fully disbursed, and the first payment is due within 60 days after the final disbursement. Repayment may be deferred while at least a half-time student; however, the unpaid interest is added to the principal.\\nThe interest rate is currently fixed at 6.28% and charged from the date of the first disbursement until the loan is paid in full.\\nFor undergraduate students, the loan is a commitment by the parent, rather than the student.\\nSeveral different repayment plans are available.\\nCredit history is taken into account, while with Stafford loans it is not.\\nDo not have the postponement and discharge (cancellation) options available with Stafford loans.\\n\\nChanges as of July 1, 2006\\nLike the Stafford Loan program, the PLUS program changed to a higher, but fixed rate, structure for loans disbursed after midnight, July 1, 2006. The rate offered through the Direct Loan Program was 7.9%. Additionally, the PLUS program was made available for graduate and professional students to borrow to finance their own educations, commonly referred to as the Grad PLUS loan.\\n\\nChanges as of July 1, 2008\\nFor PLUS loans made to parents that are first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, the borrower has the option of beginning repayment on the PLUS loan either 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed or wait until six months after the dependent student on whose behalf the parent borrowed ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.\\n\\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a form completed by current and prospective college students (undergraduate and graduate) in the United States to determine their eligibility for student financial aid.\\nThe FAFSA is different from CSS Profile (short for \"College Scholarship Service Profile\"), which is also required by some colleges (primarily private ones). The CSS is a fee-based product of the College Board (a private non-profit organization) and is used by the colleges to distribute their own institutional funds, rather than federal or state funding.\\n\\nEligibility\\nIn order to receive federal student financial aid, students must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nhave maintained a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP);\\nbe a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an eligible non-citizen;\\nhave a valid Social Security number;\\nhave a high school diploma or GED;\\nhave signed the certification statement stating that: 1) they are not in default on a federal student loan and do not owe money on a federal student grant and 2) federal student aid will only be used for educational purposes;\\nhave not been found guilty of the sale or possession of illegal drugs while federal aid was being received.Male students between the ages of 18 and 25 were generally required be registered with the Selective Service System (for Conscription in the United States), but the FAFSA Simplification Act removed this requirement starting with the 2021–2022 school year. The FAFSA Simplification Act was a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\\nStudents who are military veterans and active duty service members may apply for financial aid by filing a FAFSA even if they also apply for education and housing benefits offered by the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill and its accompanying Yellow Ribbon program. The amount of military aid a student receives for a college education does not defer eligibility or reduce the amount of student aid that student could receive from the four federal grant programs – Pell, SMART, FSEOG, and TEACH – and many of the state student aid programs.\\nStudent Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA) of 2010 changed the criteria for suspension of eligibility for drug-related offenses. Previously, students could lose eligibility for either the possession or sale of a controlled substance during the period of enrollment. SAFRA dropped the penalties for possession of a controlled substance but retained the penalties for sale of a controlled substance. SAFRA increases the suspension to two years for a first offense and indefinite for a second offense.\\nMost students who are eligible to receive federal aid and complete the FAFSA will receive some form of financial aid regardless of their financial need.\\n\\nPreparation and filing options\\nAs of the 2017–2018 academic year, the FAFSA is made available to the public on October 1 every year for the future academic year. The 2016–2017 academic year was the final time the FAFSA was not made available until January 1. The US Department of Education made the FAFSA available earlier to more closely align the timing of the financial aid application process with the typical college application process. Additionally, 2-year old US tax information is used to complete the financial sections of the FAFSA beginning with the 2017–2018 academic year. This change in using \"prior-prior tax year\" information enables families to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the FAFSA to verify their tax information without a delay from the IRS processing tax information. Some financial aid is provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and students are encouraged to submit a FAFSA as soon as possible.According to the U.S. Department of Education\\'s website, students have three options for filling out the form:\\nonline at fafsa.gov (Other websites such as fafsa.com, fafsa.net, may appear to be official but most of these sites charge a fee for assistance) (FAFSA stands for the Free application For Federal Student Aid so no other website should be used other than the official one listed above)\\nin the myStudentAid mobile app\\nCall 1-800-433-3243 to obtain a PDF of the formThe Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 authorized fee-based FAFSA preparation. By law, fee-based FAFSA preparation services must on initial contact with students inform them of the free option and be transparent about their non-affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education and their fees.\\n\\nApplication process\\nApplicants complete the FAFSA by providing their demographic and financial information and, in many cases, the demographic and financial information of their parents/guardians. In addition to this demographic and financial information, applicants can list up to ten schools to receive the results of the application once it is processed. Historically, there was some concern that colleges could deny admission, waitlist applicants, or offer less financial aid as a result of the order in which applicants list schools on the application, or FAFSA position. However, the US Department of Education changed the FAFSA for the 2016–2017 academic year to prevent schools from having access to view other schools that may be listed on the application.After completing the FAFSA, students are presented with a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR provides a student with their potential eligibility for different types of financial aid, their Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and a summary of the data a student provided in the application. An electronic version of the SAR (called an ISIR) is made available to the colleges/universities the student includes on the FAFSA. The ISIR is also sent to state agencies that award need-based aid.\\nStudents can file an appeal with their college financial aid office in order to seek additional financial aid if their current financial situation is no longer the same as the financial information they provided on FAFSA (i.e. their parent recently lost their job). The exact appeal process can vary from school to school. SwiftStudent, a free service, provides template letters for college students to use when appealing their financial aid.Currently, students can only list ten schools on their FAFSA application. If students are applying to more than 10 colleges or universities, there are three options they can choose from that allow them to submit their FAFSA application to additional schools.\\n\\nTypes of federal financial aid\\nFederal Student Aid offers several different types of financial aid programs. Pell Grant – A grant of up to $6,195 (as of the 2019–2020 Award Year) for students with a low expected family contribution. A 2018 NerdWallet study found that students missed out on $2.6 billion in free federal Pell grants by not completing the FAFSA. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) – A grant between $100 – $4,000 for eligible students and the award is available for Undergraduate students. This grant money is limited at colleges and universities and usually is given to those who have completed their FAFSA application early and are eligible to receive this grant.Federal Direct Subsidized Loan – Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized loans are need-based loans whose interest is paid by the government while the student is enrolled at least half time. Direct Subsidized Loans have fixed interest rates for the life-time of the loan. The interest rates for new loans are set yearly by the U.S. Congress.\\nFederal Direct Unsubsidized Loan - Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not need-based, meaning that nearly all students are eligible to receive them. Unlike Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans accrue interest the moment they are applied to a student\\'s tuition account. Similar to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans have fixed interest rates that are set yearly by the U.S. Congress.\\nThe Federal Work-Study Program – An employment program that encourages students with low expected family contributions to find part-time work while pursuing their studies. The program allows the federal government to subsidize a student\\'s employer by paying around half of the student\\'s wages up to a certain amount. Students do not need to have Federal Work Study to work but some university or non-profit positions may require a student to have Federal Work Study in order to be employed.\\n\\nHistory\\nFAFSA originally came from the 1965 Higher Education Act (HEA) by President Lyndon Johnson, this established the United States Government as the primary provider of financial aid for students. For years the application was called Financial Aid Form (FAF), which was an optional form used by some—but not all—colleges and universities. When Congress reauthorized the HEA in 1992 they created a standardized federal form for all prospective students seeking aid. The stated goal of FAFSA and other government funded education programs was to create equal opportunities for students seeking higher education. When the HEA was reauthorized again in 2008 lawmakers added a clause that schools must report information about who is receiving financial aid.  Subsequent studies revealed continued inequality for students of color, who often had to take out more student loans than more privileged counterparts.Recent updates have been made to increase accessibility of financial aid. The original FAFSA form had 108 questions, which was a significant barrier for many low-income families seeking financial aid. The questions were broadly seen as excessively detailed and unnecessarily complicated, with students being required to dedicate several hours to completing their application. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 shortened the FAFSA from 108 questions to 36, to encourage more eligible students to fill out the form.  In addition, students now have the option to link their IRS account with their FAFSA account to make the application simpler to complete accurately. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also opened financial aid eligibility to students that had previously been excluded from the program.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"]},"execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["documents"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9713,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701558098577,"user":{"displayName":"Ureem James","userId":"12473310198316461181"},"user_tz":300},"id":"QAQJLkKEtmAp","outputId":"18ff4b0d-3e39-4283-d277-009ec7f27ec9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /tmp/llama_index...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n"]}],"source":["index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n","index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir=\"generated_index.json\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true,"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WZYZFjqDppSw"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["If you are unable to pay back your loans, there are options available to you.
