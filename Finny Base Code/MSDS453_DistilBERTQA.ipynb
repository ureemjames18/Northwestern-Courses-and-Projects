education. In 2018, 70 percent of higher education graduates had used loans to cover some or all of their expenses. With notable exceptions, student loans must be repaid, in contrast to other forms of financial aid such as scholarships, which are not repaid, and grants, which rarely have to be repaid. Student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy, but this is difficult.Student loan debt has proliferated since 2006, totaling $1.73 trillion by July 2021. In 2019, students who borrowed to complete a bachelor's degree had about $30,000 of debt upon graduation.: 1   Almost half of all loans are for graduate school, typically in much higher amounts.: 1   Loan amounts vary widely based on race, social class, age, institution type, and degree sought. As of 2017, student debt constituted the largest non-mortgage liability for US households. Research indicates that increasing borrowing limits drives tuition increases.Student loan defaults are disproportionately common in the for-profit college sector. Around 2010, about 10 percent of college students attended for-profit colleges, but almost 40 percent of all defaults on federal student loans were to for-profit attendees. The schools whose students have the highest amount of debt are University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University. Except for Nova Southeastern, they are all for-profit. In 2018, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the 12-year student loan default rate for for-profit colleges was 52 percent.The default rate for borrowers who do not complete their degree is three times the rate for those who did.: 1  A Brookings Institution study from 2023 revealed that when the government pauses repayment on student loans, it most often \"...benefit[s] affluent borrowers the most...\" primarily due to affluent borrowers holding the largest student debt balances.\n","\n","History\n","Federal student loans were first offered in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act (NDEA). They were available only to select categories of students, such as those studying engineering, science, or education. The program was established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite. It addressed the widespread perception that the United States had fallen behind in science and technology. Student loans became more broadly available in the 1960s under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with the goal of encouraging greater social mobility and equal opportunity.In 1967, the publicly owned Bank of North Dakota made the first federally-insured student loan.The US first major government loan program was the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), formed in 1973.Before 2010, federal loans included:\n","\n","loans originated and funded directly by the Department of Education (DOE)\n","government guaranteed loans originated and funded by private investors.Direct-to-consumer private loans were the fastest-growing segment of education finance. The \"percentage of undergraduates obtaining private loans from 2003–04 to 2007–08 rose from 5 percent to 14 percent\" and was under legislative scrutiny due to the lack of school certification.The rules for disability discharge underwent major changes as a result of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. The regulations took effect July 1, 2010. In June 2010, the amount of student loan debt held by Americans exceeded the amount of credit card debt held by Americans. At that time, student loan debt totalled at least $830 billion, of which approximately 80% was federal and 20% was private. By the fourth quarter of 2015, total outstanding student loans owned and securitized had surpassed $1.3 trillion.Guaranteed loans were eliminated in 2010 through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act and replaced with direct loans. The Obama administration claimed that guaranteed loans benefited private companies at taxpayer expense but did not reduce student costs.The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) ended private-sector lending under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) starting July 1, 2010; all subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, PLUS loans, and Consolidation loans are under the Federal Direct Loan Program.As of July 1, 2013, borrowers determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration would be accepted for loan discharge if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle. As of January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 established that debt discharged due to the death or disability of the borrower was no longer treated as taxable income. (This provision is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025.)In an effort to improve the student loan market, LendKey, SoFi (Social Finance, Inc.) and CommonBond began offering student loans and refinancing at lower rates than traditional lenders, using an alumni-funded model. According to a 2016 analysis by online student loan marketplace Credible, about 8 million borrowers could qualify for refinancing.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's February 2017 Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit reported 11.2% of aggregate student loan debt was 90 or more days delinquent.On July 25, 2018, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued an order declaring that the Borrower Defense Program (enacted in November 2016), would be replaced with a stricter repayment policy, effective July 1, 2019. When a school closes for fraud before conferring degrees, students would have to prove that they were financially harmed. As of 2018, 10% of borrowers were in default after three years and 16 percent after five years.In 2019, President Donald Trump ordered loan forgiveness for permanently disabled veterans, saving 25,000 veterans an average of $30,000 each. The same year, Theresa Sweet and other student loan debtors filed a claim against the US Department of Education, arguing that they had been defrauded by their colleges. The debtors filed under a rule known as Borrower Defense to Repayment.In 2021, student loan servicers began dropping out of the federal student loan business, including FedLoan Servicing on July 8, Granite State Management and Resources on July 20, and Navient on September 28. According to Sallie Mae, as of 2021, 1 in 8 families lenders are using private student loans when federal financing doesn't cover all college costs.In July 2021, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that private student loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy, following two other cases.In August 2021, the Biden administration announced it would use executive action to cancel $5.8 billion in student loans held by 323,000 people who are permanently disabled.Starting in March 2020, federal student loan borrowers received temporary relief from student loan payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This relief was subsequently extended multiple times, and is set to expire at the end of June 2023.According to repayment data released by the Education Department, in December 2021, just 1.2 percent of borrowers were continuing to pay down their loans during the over two years of optional deferment.In November 2022, federal judge William Alsup ruled for immediate relief for about 200,000 student debtors and in April 2023 US Supreme Justice Elana Kagan declined to grant emergency relief to three for-profit colleges.In February 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Biden v. Nebraska concerning President Biden's order to cancel student loan debt for an estimated 40 million debtors.In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nebraska to block Biden's plan to forgive federal student loans.\n","\n","Overview\n","Student loans play a significant role in U.S. higher education. Nearly 20 million Americans attend college each year, of whom close to 12 million –  or 60% –  borrow annually to help cover costs. As of 2021, approximately 45 million Americans held student debt, with an average balance of approximately $30,000.In Europe, higher education receives more government funding, making student loans less common. In parts of Asia and Latin America government funding for post-secondary education is lower –  usually limited to flagship universities, like UNAM in Mexico –  and government programs under which students can borrow money are uncommon.In the United States, college is funded by government grants, scholarships, loans. The primary grant program is Pell grants.Student loans come in several varieties, but are basically either federal loans or private student loans. Federal loans are either subsidized (the government pays the interest) and unsubsidized. Federal student loans are subsidized for undergraduates only. Subsidized loans generally defer payments and interest until some period (usually six months) after the student has left school. Some states have their own loan programs, as do some colleges. In almost all cases, these student loans have better conditions than private loans.Student loans may be used for college-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers, and transportation.\n","\n","Demographics\n","Approximately 30% of all college students do not borrow. In 2019, the average undergraduate who had taken on debt had a loan balance of about $30,000 upon graduation. Almost half of the student loans are for graduate education, and those loan amounts are typically much higher.: 1\n","\n","Social class\n","According to the Saint Louis Federal Reserve Bank, \"existing racial wealth disparities and soaring higher education costs may replicate racial wealth disparities across generations by driving racial disparities in student loan debt load and repayment.\"Low-income students often prefer grants and scholarships over loans because of their difficulty repaying them. In 2004, 88.5% of Pell Grant recipients who had bachelor's degrees graduated with student loan debt. After college, students struggle to break into a higher income bracket because of the loans they owe. Though, it's been shown that when it comes to student loan forgiveness and advocacy around this issue, lower-socioeconomic groups are the ones most motivated to contact their legislators about student loans. In 1995, 64 percent of students whose family incomes falling below $35,000 were contacting their legislators concerning student loans.\n","\n","Race and gender\n","According to the New York Times, \"recent black graduates of four-year colleges owe, on average, $7,400 more than their white peers. Four years after graduation, they still owe an average of $53,000, almost twice as much as whites.\"According to an analysis by Demos, 12 years after entering college:\n","\n","White men paid off 44 percent of their student-loan balance\n","White women paid off 28 percent\n","Black men saw their balances grow 11 percent\n","Black women saw their loan balances grow 13 percent\n","\n","Age\n","According to a CNBC analysis, the highest student debt balances are carried by adults aged 25–49, with the lowest debt loads held by those aged 62 and older.As of 2021, approximately 7.8 million Americans from 18 to 25 carry student loan debt, with an average balance of almost $15,000. For adults between the ages of 35 and 49, the average individual balance owed exceeded $42,000. The average debt for adults between 50 and 61 is slightly lower. These balances include loans for their education and their children.\n","\n","Federal loans\n","Loans to students\n","Stafford and Perkins loans were federal loans made to students. These loans did not consider credit history (most students have no credit history); approval was automatic if the student met program requirements. Nearly all students are eligible to receive federal loans.\n","\n","Payment/discharge\n","The student makes no payments while enrolled at least half-time. If a student drops below half time or graduates, a six-month deferment begins. If the student returns to least half-time status, the loans are again deferred, but a second episode no longer qualifies and repayment must begin. All Perkins loans and some undergraduate Stafford loans are subsidized. Loan amounts are limited.\n","Many deferment and forbearance options are offered in the Federal Direct Student Loan program.Disabled borrowers have the possibility of discharge. Other discharge provisions are available for teachers in specific critical subjects or in a school that has more than 30% of its students on reduced-price lunch. They qualify for discharge of Stafford, Perkins, and Federal Family Education Loan Program loans up to $77,500.Any person employed full-time by a 501(c)(3) non-profit group, or another qualifying public service organization, or serving in a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps position, qualifies for discharge after 120 qualifying payments. However, loan discharge is considered taxable income. Loans discharged that were not the result of long-term public service employment constitute taxable income. Student loan borrowers may have their existing federal student loan debt removed if they can prove that their school misled them. The program is called Borrower Defense to Repayment or Borrower Defense.Subsidies are conditional depending on financial need. Pricing and loan limits are determined by Congress. Undergraduates typically receive lower interest rates, while graduate students typically can borrow more. Disregarding risk has been criticized as contributing to inefficiency. Financial needs may vary from school to school. The government covers interest charges while the student is in college. For example, those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 upon graduation.\n","\n","Terms\n","Loans are guaranteed by DOE, either directly or through guarantee agencies.\n","The dependent undergraduate limits are $5,500 per year for freshman undergraduates, $6,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $7,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduates, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or coursework preparatory for graduate programs.For independent undergraduates, the limits are $9,500 per year for freshmen, $10,500 for sophomores, and $12,500 per year for juniors and seniors, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs.\n","Unsubsidized loans are also guaranteed, but interest accrues during study. Nearly all students are eligible for these loans regardless of financial need. Those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 plus interest upon graduation. Accrued interest is added to the loan amount, and the borrower makes payments on the total. Students can make payments while studying.\n","Graduate students have higher limits: $8,500 for subsidized Stafford and $12,500 (varying by course of study) for unsubsidized Stafford. For graduate students, the Perkins limit is $6,000 per year.\n","\n","Stafford loan aggregate limits\n","Stafford borrowers cannot exceed aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For dependent undergraduates, the aggregate limit is $57,500, while subsidized loans are limited to $23,000. Students who reach the maximum in subsidized loans may (based on grade level—undergraduate, graduate/professional, etc.) add a loan of less than or equal to the amount they would have been eligible for in subsidized loans. Once aggregate limits are met, the student is ineligible for additional Stafford loans until they pay back a portion of the borrowed funds. A student who has paid back some of these amounts regains eligibility up to the aggregate limits as before. Graduate students have a lifetime aggregate loan limit of $138,500.\n","\n","Debt statistics\n","Direct loans ($1.15 trillion, 34.2 million borrowers)\n","FFEL loans ($281.8 billion, 13.5 million borrowers). The program ended in 2010.\n","Perkins loans ($7.1 billion, 2.3 million borrowers). The program ended in 2018.\n","Total ($1.4392 trillion, 42.9 million borrowers)\n","\n","Loans to parents\n","PLUS loans are federal education loans made to parents. These have much higher loan limits, usually enough to cover costs that exceed student financial aid. Payments start immediately after education ends, although prepayment is allowed. Credit history is considered; thus, approval is not automatic.\n","Interest accrues during the time the student is in school. PLUS interest rates as of 2017 were 7%.The parents are personally responsible for repayment. The parents sign the master promissory note and are accountable. Parents are advised to consider their monthly payments. Loan documents reflect the repayment schedule for a single year. Since most students borrow again each year, the ultimate payments are much higher. PLUS loans consider credit history, making it more difficult for low-income parents to qualify.\n","Graduate students are eligible to receive PLUS loans in their own names. Graduate PLUS loans have the same interest rates and terms as those to parents.\n","Federal Direct Student Loans, also known as Direct Loans or FDLP loans, originate with the United States Treasury. FDLP loans are distributed by the DOE, then to the college or university and then to the student.\n","\n","Debt levels\n","Loan limits are below the cost of most four-year private institutions and most public universities. Students add private student loans to make up the difference.The maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change.\n","\n","Defaults\n","Out of 100 students who ever attended a for-profit institution, 23 defaulted in the 1996 cohort compared to 43 in the 2004 cohort (compared to an increase from 8 to 11 among borrowers who never attended a for-profit).As of 2018 black BA graduates defaulted at five times the rate of white BA graduates (21 versus 4 percent), and were more likely to default than white dropouts.\n","\n","Private loans\n","Private loans are offered by banks or finance companies. They are not guaranteed by a government agency. Private loans cost more, offer less favorable terms, and are generally used only when students have exhausted the federal borrowing limit. They are not eligible for Income-Based Repayment plans, and frequently have less flexible payment terms, higher fees, and more penalties, than federal student loans. Private loans may be difficult to discharge through bankruptcy.Private loans are made to students or parents. They have higher limits and no payments until after education, although interest starts to accrue immediately and the deferred interest is added to the principal. Interest rates are higher on federal loans, which are set by the United States Congress.The advantage of private student loans is that they do not include loan or total debt limits. They typically offer a no-payment grace period of six months (occasionally 12 months).\n","Most experts recommend private loans only as a last resort, because of the less favorable terms.\n","\n","Loan types\n","Private student loans generally come in two types: school-channel and direct-to-consumer.\n","School-channel loans offer borrowers lower interest rates, but generally take longer to process. These loans are \"certified\" by the school, which means the school signs off on the borrowing amount, and the funds are disbursed directly to the school. The \"certification\" means only that the school confirms the loan funds will be used for educational expenses only and agrees to hold them and disburse them as needed. Certification does not mean that the school approves of, recommends, or has even examined the loan terms.\n","Direct-to-consumer private loans do not involve the school. The student supplies enrollment verification to the lender, and the loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the student. While direct-to-consumer loans generally carry higher interest rates than school-channel loans, they allow families access to funds more quickly — in some cases, in a matter of days. This convenience comes at the risk of student over-borrowing and/or use of funds for inappropriate purposes.Loan providers range from large education finance companies to speciality companies that focus exclusively on this niche.\n","\n","Interest rates\n","Private student loans usually have substantially higher interest rates, and the rates fluctuate depending on the financial markets. Some private loans require substantial up-front origination fees (\"points\") along with lower interest rates. Interest rates also vary depending on the applicant's credit history.\n","Most private loan programs are tied to financial indexes such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller loan origination fees than those with poorer credit histories. Interest payments are tax deductible.\n","Lenders rarely give complete details of loan terms until after an application is submitted. Many lenders advertise only the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with damaged credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, loan fees that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than those advertised figures.\n","\n","Loan fees\n","Private loans often carry an origination fee, which can be substantial. Origination fees are a one-time charge based on the amount of the loan. They can be paid from the loan proceeds or from personal funds independent of the loan amount, often at the borrower's preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans. The origination fee gets paid once, while interest is paid throughout the loan. The loan amount accumulates to about 15 billion borrowed from private loans.All lenders are legally required to provide a statement of the annual percentage rate (APR) prior to closure. Unlike the \"base\" rate, this rate includes any fees charged and can be thought of as the \"effective\" interest rate including interest, fees, etc. When comparing loans, comparing APR rather than \"rate\" ensures a valid comparison for loans that have the same repayment term. However, if the repayment terms are different, APR becomes a less-perfect comparison tool. In those circumstances comparing total financing costs may be more appropriate.\n","\n","Loan terms\n","In contrast with federal loans, whose terms are standardized, private loan terms vary from loan to loan. However, it is not easy to compare them, as some conditions may not be revealed until signing. A common suggestion is to consider all terms, not just respond to advertised interest rates. Applying to multiple lenders (to create a comparison) can damage the borrower's credit score. Examples of other terms  that vary by lender are deferments (amount of time after leaving school before payments start) and forbearances (a period when payments are temporarily stopped due to financial or other hardship).\n","\n","Cosigners\n","Private student loan programs generally issue loans based on the credit history of the applicant and any applicable cosigner, co-endorser or coborrower. Students may find that their families have too much income or too many assets to qualify for federal aid, but lack sufficient assets and income to pay for school without assistance. Most students need a cosigner in order to qualify for a private loan.Many international students can obtain private loans (they are usually ineligible for federal loans) with a cosigner who is a citizen or permanent resident. However, some graduate programs (notably top MBA programs) partner with private loan providers. In those cases, no cosigner is needed for international students.\n","\n","Loan servicers\n","The U.S. Department of Education contracts with companies to manage, or service, the loans it owns. These companies are the primary point of contact for borrowers after they graduate and enter repayment.\n","As of July 2023, the four companies which service the majority of student loans are Aidvantage, EdFinancial Services, MOHELA (Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri) and Nelnet. ECSI (Educational Computer Systems, Inc.) is the exclusive servicer for the remaining Perkins Loans. Borrowers who have defaulted on loans are assigned to the Department of Education’s Default Resolution Group for servicing.\n","\n","Student loan asset-backed securities (SLABS)\n","FFELP and private loans are bundled, securitized, rated, then sold to institutional investors as student loan asset-backed securities (SLABS). Navient and Nelnet are two major private lenders. Wells Fargo Bank, JP MorganChase, Goldman Sachs and other large banks package and sell SLABS in bundles. Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and Standard and Poor's rate SLAB quality.The Asset-Backed Security (ABS) industry received financial relief in 2008 and in 2020 through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) program, which was created to preserve the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, including student loans. In 2020, critics argued that the SLAB market was poorly regulated and could be headed toward a significant downturn, despite perceptions that it was low risk.\n","\n","Repayment and default\n","Metrics\n","The industry metrics are repayment rate and default rate, such as the one-, three-, five-, and seven-year default rates. DOE's College Scorecard includes the following repayment statuses:\n","\n","Making Progress\n","Forbearance\n","Deferment\n","Not Making Progress\n","Delinquent\n","Defaulted\n","Paid In Full\n","Discharged\n","\n","Repayment rate\n","The three-year repayment rate for each school that receives Title IV funding is available at DOE's College Scorecard. This number may be a poor indicator of the overall default rate: some schools place loans into forbearance, deferring loans beyond the three-year window to present a low default rate.\n","\n","Default rate\n","The default rate for borrowers who did not complete their degree is three times as high as the rate for those who did.: 1\n","\n","Standard repayment\n","Federal loans are initially designated as standard repayment. Standard repayment borrowers have 10 years to repay. The loan servicer calculates the monthly payment amount that will pay off the original loan amount plus all accrued interest after 120 equal payments.\n","Payments cover interest and part of the principal. Some loan terms may be shorter than 10 years. The minimum monthly payment is  $50.\n","\n","Income-related repayment\n","Income-based repayment\n","If loan debt is high but income is modest or zero, borrowers may qualify for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Most major types of federal student loans—except for PLUS loans for parents—are eligible. IDRs allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments at 10%, 15%, or 20% of disposable income for up to 20 or 25 years, after which the remaining balance is forgiven.Four IDRs are available:\n","\n","Income-Based Repayment (IBR)\n","Pay As You Earn (PAYE)\n","Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)\n","Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)\n","\n","Income share agreements\n","An income share agreement is an alternative to a traditional loan. The borrower agrees to pay a percentage of their salary to the educational institution after graduation. Purdue University offers income share agreements.\n","\n","Defenses to repayment\n","Under some circumstances, debt can be cancelled. For example, students who attended a school when it closed or the student was enrolled based on false claims may be able to escape repayment.\n","\n","Leaving the country to evade repayment\n","Debt evasion is the intentional act of trying to avoid attempts by creditors to collect a debt. News accounts report that some individuals are departing the US to escape their debt. Emigration does not discharge the loan or stop interest and penalties from accruing.\n","International addresses make it more difficult to find people, and collection companies would usually need to hire an international counsel or a third party collector to recoup the debt, cutting into their profits and reducing their incentive to go after a debtor.  'It increases our expenses to go overseas,' says Justin Berg of American Profit Recovery, a debt collection agency in Massachusetts. 'Our revenues are cut by more than half,' he says.\"\n","Nations may enter into agreements with the US to facilitate the collection of student loans.After default, co-signers remain liable for repayment.\n","\n","Bankruptcy\n","Federal loans and some private loans can be discharged in bankruptcy by demonstrating that the loan does not meet the requirements of section 523(a)(8) of the bankruptcy code or by showing that repayment of the loan would constitute \"undue hardship\". While credit card debt often can be discharged through bankruptcy proceedings, this option is not generally available for federally subsidize or insured student loans. Unless the loan can be proven not to be an educational benefit, those seeking to discharge their debt must initiate an adversary proceeding, a separate lawsuit within the bankruptcy case where they illustrate the required hardship. Many borrowers cannot afford the costs to retain an attorney or litigation costs associated with an adversary proceeding, such as a bankruptcy case. The undue hardship standard varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but is generally difficult to meet. In most circuit courts discharge depends on meeting the three prongs in the Brunner test: As noted by the district court, there is very little appellate authority on the definition of \"undue hardship\" in the context of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8)(B). Based on legislative history and the decisions of other district and bankruptcy courts, the district court adopted a standard for \"undue hardship\" requiring a three-part showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \"minimal\" standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans. For the reasons set forth in the district court's order, we adopt this analysis. The first part of this test has been applied frequently as the minimum necessary to establish \"undue hardship.\" See, e.g., Bryant v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Bryant), 72 B.R. 913, 915 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1987); North Dakota State Bd. of Higher Educ. v. Frech (In re Frech), 62 B.R. 235 (Bankr.D.Minn.1986); Marion v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Marion), 61 B.R. 815 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1986). Requiring such a showing comports with common sense as well.\n","Federal student loans may be eligible for administrative discharge. Those provisions do not apply to private loans, although private loans may be subject to discharge in bankruptcy. One study found that a quarter million student debtors file for bankruptcy each year. Approximately 450 attempted to seek a discharge in 2017 by arguing that their loan was not an \"educational benefit\" as defined by section 523(a)(8), or they successfully argued for \"undue hardship\". Of the completed cases, more than 60% were able to discharge their debts or achieve a settlement. The study concluded that the data showed: Creditors are settling unfavorable cases to avoid adverse precedent and litigating good cases to cultivate favorable precedent. Ultimately, this litigation strategy has distorted the law and cultivated the myth of nondischargeability.The study found that debtors who obtain favorable outcomes do not possess unique characteristics differentiating them from those who do not seek discharge and estimates that 64,000 individuals who filed for bankruptcy in 2019 would have met the hardship standard. It concluded about half of all bankrupt debtors could obtain relief, except that they had become convinced that loans were not dischargeable.For disabled debtors the standard is whether \"substantial gainful activity\" (SGA) is still possible Borrowers determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration, are eligible if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle. Debt discharged due to death or total permanent disability is nontaxable.In three circuit court jurisdictions private student loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n","\n","Criticisms\n","School effects\n","Some critics of financial aid in general claim that it allows schools to raise their fees, to accept unprepared students, and to produce too many graduates in some fields of study.In 1987, then-Secretary of Education William Bennett argued that “... increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise tuition, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.” This statement came to be known as the “Bennett Hypothesis”.\n","In July 2015, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report concluded that institutions more exposed to increases in student loan program maximums tended to respond with disproportionate tuition increases. Pell Grant, subsidized, and unsubsidized loans led to increases of about 40, 60, and 15 cents on the dollar, respectively. In the 20 years between 1987 and 2007, tuition costs rose 326%. Public universities increased their fees by 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, while out-of-state students paid more than $19,000. For the two decades ending in 2013, college costs rose 1.6% more than inflation each year. By contrast, government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012.Many students cannot get loans or determine that the cost of going to school is not worth the debt, believing that they would still be unable to make enough income to pay it back.Some universities steered borrowers to preferred lenders that charged higher interest rates. Some of these lenders allegedly paid kick backs to university financial aid staff. After the behavior became public, many universities rebated fees to affected borrowers.\n","\n","Interest rates\n","The federal student loan program was criticized for not adjusting interest rates according to factors under students' control, such as the choice of academic major. Critics have contended that flat-rate pricing contributes to inefficiency and misallocation of resources in higher education and lower productivity in the labor market. However, one study found that high debt and default levels do not burden society substantially.\n","\n","Bankruptcy\n","In 2009 student loans' non-dischargeability was claimed to provide a credit risk-free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.\n","\n","Long-term debt and default\n","About one-third of borrowers never pay off their loans. Those who default shift their burden to taxpayers.According to Harvard Business School researchers, \"when student debt is erased, a huge burden is lifted and people take big steps to improve their lives: They seek higher-paying careers in new states, improve their education, get their other finances in order, and make more substantial contributions to the economy.\"\n","\n","Sallie Mae and Nelnet\n","Sallie Mae and Nelnet are the largest lenders and are frequently defendants in lawsuits. The False Claims Suit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former DOE researcher Dr. Jon Oberg against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the United States Government and defrauded taxpayers of over $22 million. In August 2010, Nelnet settled and paid $55 million. Ultimately seven lenders returned taxpayer funds as a result of his lawsuits.\n","\n","School quality\n","In April 2019, Brookings Institution fellow Adam Looney, a long-time analyst of student loans, claimed that:\"It is an outrage that the federal government offers loans to students at low-quality institutions even when we know those schools don’t boost their earnings and that those borrowers won’t be able to repay their loans. It is an outrage that we make parent PLUS loans to the poorest families when we know they almost surely will default and have their wages and social security benefits garnished and their tax refunds confiscated, as $2.8 billion was in 2017. It is an outrage that we saddled several million students with loans to enroll in untested online programs that seem to have offered no labor market value. It is an outrage that our lending programs encourage schools like USC to charge $107,484 (and students to blithely enroll) for a master’s degree in social work (220 percent more than the equivalent course at UCLA) in a field where the median wage is $47,980. It’s no wonder many borrowers feel their student loans led to economic catastrophe.\"\n","\n","Potential consequences of student loan debt\n","While college grads earn about 70% more than people with only a high school degree, student loan debt has been associated with several social, economic, and psychological consequences, including - having to choose less satisfying work that pays more\n","lower credit ratings from missed payments that may disqualify borrowers from work opportunities given poor payment history, reduced wealth accumulation, reduced housing access, delayed marriage, delayed childbirth, decreased retirement security and increased anxiety\n","\n","Reform proposals\n","Organizations that advocate for student loan reform include the Debt Collective and Student Loan Justice.Some pundits proposed that colleges share liability on defaulted student loans.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) introduced legislation in 2017 to \"make public colleges and universities tuition-free for working families and to significantly reduce student debt.\" The policy would eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities, lower interest rates, and allow those with existing debt to refinance. Sanders offered a new proposal in 2019 that would cancel $1.6 trillion of student loan, undergraduate and graduate debt for around 45 million Americans.Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) reintroduced the Debt Free College Act in 2019.In 2020, a majority of economists surveyed by the Initiative on Global Markets felt that forgiving all student loans would be more beneficial to higher income earners than lower income earners.During the 2020 presidential election, then-candidate Joe Biden said he planned to allow $10,000 in debt forgiveness to all student debtors. On August 24, 2022, Biden announced that he would forgive an amount of $10,000 for an estimated 43 million borrowers, and an additional $10,000 for Pell Grant recipients, with this relief limited to singles earning under $125,000 and married couples earning under $250,000, including refunding payments during the forbearance period by any borrower who requests it. This would reduce debt for an estimated 43 million borrowers and eliminate student loan debt for an estimated 20 million.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost the government about $400 billion. The administration also proposed a new income-driven repayment plan. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 30, 2023 that Biden's plan required action by Congress and that the HEROES Act did not permit the administration to act on its own.Some borrowers still have loans issued under the Federal Family Education Loan Program which closed in 2010. The Biden forgiveness plan originally allowed these borrowers to receive forgiveness by consolidating into Direct Loans, but due to potential lawsuits stopped allowing this on September 29, 2022, potentially excluding 800,000 FFEL borrowers.\n","\n","\n","Defaulter demographics\n","According to analysis of borrowers from the 2003-2004 academic year over a twelve-year period, defaulters generally tend to be older, lower income, and more financially independent than those who did not default. Borrowers typically owe $9,625, which is $8,500 less than the median loan balance of a non-defaulter. The majority of defaulters did not complete their bachelor's degree, but the median completed at least one year of study while maintaining grades in the C+/B- range. This shows that defaulters are able to complete college level work. Furthermore, most borrowers do not immediately enter default - the median borrower takes 33 months to enter default on their federal loans. Generally, a little more than half of all defaulters are able to rehabilitate their debt.\n","\n","Debt rehabilitation\n","There are a number of paths to resolving student debt default, including:\n","\n","Completing 10 months of agreed upon payments\n","Repayment via debt consolidation or other types of loans\n","Discharge via total and permanent disability\n","Discharge via bankruptcy\n","\n","A private student loan is a financing option for higher education in the United States that can supplement, but should not replace, federal loans, such as Stafford loans, Perkins loans and PLUS loans. Private loans, which are heavily advertised, do not have the forbearance and deferral options available with federal loans (which are never advertised). In contrast with federal subsidized loans, interest accrues while the student is in college, even if repayment does not begin until after graduation. While unsubsidized federal loans do have interest charges while the student is studying, private student loan rates are usually higher, sometimes much higher. Fees vary greatly, and legal cases have reported collection charges reaching 50% of amount of the loan. Since 2011, most private student loans are offered with zero fees, effectively rolling the fees into the interest rates.\n","Interest rates and loan terms are set by the financial institution that underwrites the loan, typically based on the perceived risk that the borrower may be delinquent or in default of payments of the loan. Most lenders assign interest rates based on 4-6 tiers of credit scores. The underwriting decision is complicated by the fact that students often do not have a credit history that would indicate creditworthiness. As a result, interest rates may vary considerably across lenders, and some loans have variable interest rates. More than 90% of private student loans to undergraduate students and more than 75% of private student loans to graduate students require a creditworthy cosigner.Unlike other consumer loans, Congress made student loans, both federal and private, exempt from discharge (cancellation) in the event of a personal bankruptcy, except when repaying the student loan would represent an undue hardship on the borrower and the borrower's dependents. This is a serious restriction that students rarely understand when obtaining a student loan.\n","Financial aid, including loans, may not exceed the college's cost of attendance.\n","\n","Parallels to mortgage lending\n","The increase in use of private student loans came about around 2001 once the increase in the cost of education began to exceed the increase in the amount of federal student aid available.The recent history of student loans has been compared to the history of the mortgage industry. Similar to the way in which mortgages were securitized and sold off by lenders to investors, student loans were also sold off to investors, thereby eliminating the risk of loss for the actual lender.\n","Another parallel between the student loan industry and the mortgage industry is the fact that subprime lending has run rampant over the past few years. Just as little documentation was needed to take out a subprime mortgage loan, even less was needed to take out a subprime or \"non-traditional\" student loan.\n","\n","Criticisms\n","After the passage of the bankruptcy reform bill of 2005, even private student loans are not discharged during bankruptcy. This provided a credit-risk-free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.In 2007, the then-Attorney General of New York State, Andrew Cuomo, led an investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities.  Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to \"preferred lenders\" which resulted in those borrowers incurring higher interest rates.  Some of these \"preferred lenders\" allegedly rewarded university financial aid staff with \"kickbacks.\"  This has led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities.  Many universities have also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers.The biggest lenders, Sallie Mae and Nelnet, are criticized by borrowers. They frequently find themselves embroiled in lawsuits, the most serious of which was filed in 2007. The False Claims Suit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former Department of Education researcher, Dr. Jon Oberg, against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the U.S. Government and defrauded taxpayers of millions of dollars. In August 2010, Nelnet settled the lawsuit and paid $55 million.Prior to 2009, most private student loans did not offer death and disability discharges. After the Boston Globe published an article critical of Sallie Mae's failure to discharge the private student loans of a Marine killed in action, Sallie Mae launched a new student loan program with death and disability discharges similar to those available on federal student loans. Since then, about half of private student loans offer death and disability discharges.\n","In 2011, The New York Times published an editorial endorsing the return of bankruptcy protections for private student loans in response to the economic downturn and universally increasing tuition at all colleges and graduate institutions.A 2014 report from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), shows a rising problem with these types of loans. Borrowers face “auto-default” when cosigner dies or goes bankrupt. The report shows that some lenders demand immediate full repayment upon the death or bankruptcy of their loan cosigner, even when the loan is current and being paid on time.\n","\n","Participants\n","The biggest student loan lender, Sallie Mae, was formerly a government-sponsored entity, which became private between 1997-2004. A number of financial institutions offer private student loans, including banks like Wells Fargo, and specialized companies. There are also a number of state-affiliated, nonprofit student loan lenders, which account for approximately 10% of the private student loan market. This segment includes organizations such as VSAC and Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri, Student loan search and comparison websites allow visitors to evaluate loan terms from a variety of partner lenders, and financial aid offices in universities typically have a preferred vendor list, but borrowers are free to obtain loans wherever they can find the most favorable terms.As the economy collapsed in 2008-2011, many players withdrew from the private student loan lending world.  The remaining lenders tightened the credit criteria, making it more difficult to receive a loan.  Most now require a credit-worthy cosigner. After the economic collapse of 2008, a number of peer-to-peer lending and alternative lending platforms emerged to help students find private student loans. For example, U.S. online marketplace lending platform LendKey allows consumers to book loans directly from community lenders like credit unions and community banks.\n","\n","\n","Qualifying employers\n","Government organizations or agencies (federal, state or local), 501(c)(3) organizations as defined by the IRS, and some other types of not-for-profit organizations providing designated public services qualify for PSLF.\n","The nature of the individual's job responsibilities is not a determining factor in whether the employment qualifies. Rather, only the employer's status as a qualifying employer determines whether the employment qualifies.\n","With limited exception, the individual must be directly employed by the qualifying employer. Therefore, government contractors will not qualify on the basis of their government contracts. Instead, they must independently be a qualifying employer. Another example is the national labs. Employees at national labs such as a Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration Lab, do not qualify on the basis of managing a lab for the government; rather, the managing entity of the lab must be a qualifying employer.\n","\n","Eligible loans\n","Any loan made under the Direct Loan Program can qualify for PSLF. In particular, Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans qualify for PSLF.\n","Loans in the FFEL program or Federal Perkins Loans can be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan to become eligible for the program. Private student loans are ineligible to be consolidated into a Direct Loan and thus cannot be discharged under the PSLF program.\n","\n","Qualifying for forgiveness\n","An individual qualifies for PSLF after making 120 on-time, monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. After the borrower has made 120 qualifying payments, any remaining balance of the borrower’s eligible student loan is forgiven without any tax implications. Currently, there is no cap as to the amount of forgiveness a borrower can receive.\n","Those interested in receiving PSLF should regularly submit the \"Employment Certification Form\" for PSLF. This form will be used by the Department of Education's contractor, Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (MOHELA) , (formerly FedLoan Servicing), to determine whether an individual's employment and payments qualify for the program.\n","\n","Qualifying payment plans\n","Multiple plans are available to those interested in the PSLF program. Those wishing to seek forgiveness under the PSLF should make payments under one of the income-driven repayment plans, including Income Contingent Repayment, Income Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, or Revised Pay As You Earn.\n","On May 23, 2018, the U.S. Department of Education announced a second-chance plan for people in public service jobs who were denied loan forgiveness because they chose the wrong repayment plan. The DoED will use $350 million set aside by Congress in a fix-it fund to help people seeking reconsideration. The money will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.\n","\n","Problems with the program\n","The earliest date that public servants could qualify for full cancelation of their loans was October 1, 2017, ten years after PSLF existed. Problems soon emerged. Of the first 28,000 public servants who applied for forgiveness, only 96 were approved. This is a denial rate of 99 percent. In March 2018 Congress attempted to fix PSLF by passing the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (TEPSLF). According to a Government Accountability Office report of the 54,184 who applied for TEPSLF 53,523 got denied. These denials are the result of many problems, including servicers who provided false or misleading information about whether an account had the right loan type and payment plan to qualify for PSLF. On October 6, 2021, the Biden administration announced a temporary waiver allowing past payments to qualify even if they had the wrong loan type or payment plan. As of March 2022 100,000 people have had over $6.2 billion of student loans canceled as a result of the waiver, however, many problems still persist. The government estimates that 1.3 million public servants qualify for PSLF. FedLoan Servicing continues to incorrectly tell people that they do not qualify for PSLF when in fact they do. FedLoan has also been sending automated messages with inaccurate payment counts. The CFPB has issued a warning to FedLoan. The Department of Education's PSLF help tool will not allow people to select that they have made over 120 payments, forcing people to fill out the form with inaccurate information or find workarounds. Applicants who have reached 120 qualified payments have reported long processing delays of three months or more after submitting PSLF forms to loan servicer, Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri.\n","\n","Future reduction proposals\n","For his 2015 budget proposal to Congress, President Barack Obama proposed capping Public Service Loan Forgiveness at $57,500 for all new borrowers. Analysis at the website Educated Risk, however, details the difficulty of modifying PSLF:The 2016 Republican budget resolution proposed to eliminate the PSLF program to all new student loan borrowers. A recent GAO report found that the cost of loan forgiveness has been underestimated, leading many commentators to speculate that a new Republican administration and Congress will take steps to curb the problem.President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the PSLF in his 2018 budget proposal. Similarly, the Republican-proposed PROSPER Act would have eliminated the PSLF. Any changes would have only applied to new borrowers as of July 1, 2019. The PROSPER Act is considered \"dead\" with Democrats retaking control of the House of Representatives in 2019.President Trump's 2019 budget proposed eliminating the PSLF. The elimination would have only affected new borrowers as of July 1, 2020. Trump's 2021 fiscal budget made a similar proposal that would only apply to new borrowers.\n","\n","Contradictory claims by the government regarding eligibility and litigation\n","In December 2016, it was reported that some employees who had been previously told by the government that their jobs were eligible for the program were later told that their jobs were not eligible. In response, the American Bar Association joined four individual plaintiffs who were denied eligibility under PSLF in a lawsuit against the United States Department of Education to stop the Department’s decision to retroactively refuse to honor loan forgiveness commitments it made to individuals who \"have dedicated their careers to public service.\" The ABA argued the Department of Education \"substantially changed its policy on PSLF-eligible employers\" which directly contradicts statutory procedures for modifying regulations requiring public notice and comment periods. On February 22, 2019, a New York federal district court found the Department of Education's actions \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The Court found: \"In adopting the new standards, the Department failed to display awareness of its changed position, provide a reasoned analysis for that decision and take into account the serious reliance interests affected.\" The Court vacated the Department's denial letters and remanded the matters to the Department of Education for reconsideration. Such ruling could lay the groundwork for borrowers who were denied loan forgiveness after being told they were eligible to appeal. The court classified the department's position as \"nonsense\". The Department elected not to appeal the ruling. The Department of Education subsequently stated that all full-time ABA employees are employed in \"a public service job\" for a \"public service organization\" as part of a settlement between the ABA and the Department. The Education Department further stated that its decision does not restrict the agency from changing the definition of a public service organization in new regulations in the future.\n","\n","The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a form completed by current and prospective college students (undergraduate and graduate) in the United States to determine their eligibility for student financial aid.\n","The FAFSA is different from CSS Profile (short for \"College Scholarship Service Profile\"), which is also required by some colleges (primarily private ones). The CSS is a fee-based product of the College Board (a private non-profit organization) and is used by the colleges to distribute their own institutional funds, rather than federal or state funding.\n","\n","Eligibility\n","In order to receive federal student financial aid, students must meet the following criteria: have maintained a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP); be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an eligible non-citizen; have a valid Social Security number;\n","have a high school diploma or GED; have signed the certification statement stating that: 1) they are not in default on a federal student loan and do not owe money on a federal student grant and 2) federal student aid will only be used for educational purposes;\n","have not been found guilty of the sale or possession of illegal drugs while federal aid was being received.Male students between the ages of 18 and 25 were generally required be registered with the Selective Service System (for Conscription in the United States), but the FAFSA Simplification Act removed this requirement starting with the 2021–2022 school year. The FAFSA Simplification Act was a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\n","Students who are military veterans and active duty service members may apply for financial aid by filing a FAFSA even if they also apply for education and housing benefits offered by the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill and its accompanying Yellow Ribbon program. The amount of military aid a student receives for a college education does not defer eligibility or reduce the amount of student aid that student could receive from the four federal grant programs – Pell, SMART, FSEOG, and TEACH – and many of the state student aid programs.\n","Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA) of 2010 changed the criteria for suspension of eligibility for drug-related offenses. Previously, students could lose eligibility for either the possession or sale of a controlled substance during the period of enrollment. SAFRA dropped the penalties for possession of a controlled substance but retained the penalties for sale of a controlled substance. SAFRA increases the suspension to two years for a first offense and indefinite for a second offense.\n","Most students who are eligible to receive federal aid and complete the FAFSA will receive some form of financial aid regardless of their financial need.\n","\n","Preparation and filing options\n","As of the 2017–2018 academic year, the FAFSA is made available to the public on October 1 every year for the future academic year. The 2016–2017 academic year was the final time the FAFSA was not made available until January 1. The US Department of Education made the FAFSA available earlier to more closely align the timing of the financial aid application process with the typical college application process. Additionally, 2-year old US tax information is used to complete the financial sections of the FAFSA beginning with the 2017–2018 academic year. This change in using \"prior-prior tax year\" information enables families to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the FAFSA to verify their tax information without a delay from the IRS processing tax information. Some financial aid is provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and students are encouraged to submit a FAFSA as soon as possible.According to the U.S. Department of Education's website, students have three options for filling out the form:\n","online at fafsa.gov (Other websites such as fafsa.com, fafsa.net, may appear to be official but most of these sites charge a fee for assistance) (FAFSA stands for the Free application For Federal Student Aid so no other website should be used other than the official one listed above)\n","in the myStudentAid mobile app\n","Call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain a PDF of the formThe Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 authorized fee-based FAFSA preparation. By law, fee-based FAFSA preparation services must on initial contact with students inform them of the free option and be transparent about their non-affiliation with the U.S. Department of Education and their fees.\n","\n","Application process\n","Applicants complete the FAFSA by providing their demographic and financial information and, in many cases, the demographic and financial information of their parents/guardians. In addition to this demographic and financial information, applicants can list up to ten schools to receive the results of the application once it is processed. Historically, there was some concern that colleges could deny admission, waitlist applicants, or offer less financial aid as a result of the order in which applicants list schools on the application, or FAFSA position. However, the US Department of Education changed the FAFSA for the 2016–2017 academic year to prevent schools from having access to view other schools that may be listed on the application.After completing the FAFSA, students are presented with a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR provides a student with their potential eligibility for different types of financial aid, their Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and a summary of the data a student provided in the application. An electronic version of the SAR (called an ISIR) is made available to the colleges/universities the student includes on the FAFSA. The ISIR is also sent to state agencies that award need-based aid.\n","Students can file an appeal with their college financial aid office in order to seek additional financial aid if their current financial situation is no longer the same as the financial information they provided on FAFSA (i.e. their parent recently lost their job). The exact appeal process can vary from school to school. SwiftStudent, a free service, provides template letters for college students to use when appealing their financial aid.Currently, students can only list ten schools on their FAFSA application. If students are applying to more than 10 colleges or universities, there are three options they can choose from that allow them to submit their FAFSA application to additional schools.\n","\n","Types of federal financial aid\n","Federal Student Aid offers several different types of financial aid programs.\n","\n","Pell Grant – A grant of up to $6,195 (as of the 2019–2020 Award Year) for students with a low expected family contribution. A 2018 NerdWallet study found that students missed out on $2.6 billion in free federal Pell grants by not completing the FAFSA.\n","Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) – A grant between $100 – $4,000 for eligible students and the award is available for Undergraduate students. This grant money is limited at colleges and universities and usually is given to those who have completed their FAFSA application early and are eligible to receive this grant.\n","Federal Direct Subsidized Loan – Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized loans are need-based loans whose interest is paid by the government while the student is enrolled at least half time. Direct Subsidized Loans have fixed interest rates for the life-time of the loan. The interest rates for new loans are set yearly by the U.S. Congress.\n","Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan - Part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not need-based, meaning that nearly all students are eligible to receive them. Unlike Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans accrue interest the moment they are applied to a student's tuition account. Similar to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans have fixed interest rates that are set yearly by the U.S. Congress.\n","The Federal Work-Study Program – An employment program that encourages students with low expected family contributions to find part-time work while pursuing their studies. The program allows the federal government to subsidize a student's employer by paying around half of the student's wages up to a certain amount. Students do not need to have Federal Work Study to work but some university or non-profit positions may require a student to have Federal Work Study in order to be employed.\n","\n","History\n","FAFSA originally came from the 1965 Higher Education Act (HEA) by President Lyndon Johnson, this established the United States Government as the primary provider of financial aid for students. For years the application was called Financial Aid Form (FAF), which was an optional form used by some—but not all—colleges and universities. When Congress reauthorized the HEA in 1992 they created a standardized federal form for all prospective students seeking aid. The stated goal of FAFSA and other government funded education programs was to create equal opportunities for students seeking higher education. When the HEA was reauthorized again in 2008 lawmakers added a clause that schools must report information about who is receiving financial aid.  Subsequent studies revealed continued inequality for students of color, who often had to take out more student loans than more privileged counterparts.Recent updates have been made to increase accessibility of financial aid. The original FAFSA form had 108 questions, which was a significant barrier for many low-income families seeking financial aid. The questions were broadly seen as excessively detailed and unnecessarily complicated, with students being required to dedicate several hours to completing their application. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 shortened the FAFSA from 108 questions to 36, to encourage more eligible students to fill out the form.  In addition, students now have the option to link their IRS account with their FAFSA account to make the application simpler to complete accurately. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also opened financial aid eligibility to students that had previously been excluded from the program.\n","\n","\n","History\n","The Student Loan Marketing Association was originally created in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and began privatizing its operations in 1997, a process it completed at the end of 2004 when Congress terminated its federal charter, ending its ties to the government. The company provides private education loans for students and their families. These loans are not made, insured, or guaranteed by any state or federal government.In 2005, Sallie Mae was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.In August 2006, Sallie Mae acquired Upromise, a company that provides rebates to buyers of certain brands, which can be applied to college savings accounts. In May 2020, Upromise was acquired by loyalty marketing company Prodege.On April 16, 2007, Sallie Mae announced that an investor group led by J.C. Flowers & Co. signed an agreement to purchase Sallie Mae for approximately $25 billion. Had the transaction been completed, J.C. Flowers, along with private-equity firm Friedman Fleischer & Lowe would have owned 50.2% of Sallie Mae, and Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase would each have owned 24.9%.  Sallie Mae would have ceased to be a publicly traded company. The deal fell through in September 2007, with the buyers blaming adverse changes to the business's outlook as a result of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 and the tightening of global credit markets following the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.  Sallie Mae subsequently began legal action, only to drop it in January 2008 upon completion of a $31 billion funding round, including funding from Bank of America.On April 6, 2009, Sallie Mae announced that it would move 2,000 jobs back to the U.S. within the next 18 months as it shifts call center and other operations from overseas.On March 31, 2010, Sallie Mae announced the impending layoff of 2,500 employees in response to the signing of new legislation calling for the federal government to lend directly to students, bypassing institutions like Sallie Mae.On July 1, 2010, Sallie Mae announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Reston, Virginia, to its existing facility in Newark, Delaware.On September 17, 2010, Sallie Mae acquired federally insured loans from Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation worth $28 billion.SLM Corporation, the company that operates Sallie Mae, was formed in 2013. On February 25, 2014, Sallie Mae announced the launch of Navient, a separate entity for federal student loan servicing. On April 30, Sallie Mae legally separated from Navient, and made its primary focus private student loans, banking products, and credit cards for college students and their families.In March 2020, the company announced Jonathan Witter, former Hilton executive, would replace Raymond Quinlan as the new CEO.Sallie Mae announced a partnership with Mpower Financing in April 2021, to expand access to higher education for international and DACA students.\n","\n","Corporate information\n","The Sallie Mae corporate headquarters is in Newark, Delaware.

Prior to Franke, Raymond J. Quinlan served in the role, having joined the board in 2014 to replace previous chairman Anthony P. Terracciano—formerly president of First Union Corporation (now Wells Fargo).  Quinlan was also the chief executive office of Sallie Mae from May 2014 until March 2020, when current CEO Jonathan Witter assumed the position.\n","\n","Awards\n","Through The Fund's work, Sallie Mae was named among BusinessWeek's Top 15 Corporate Philanthropists in 2004. The Washington Business Journal identified the company as the top local corporate philanthropist in 2005.In the early 2010s, Kiplinger's Personal Finance recognized Sallie Mae Bank as the Best Online Savings Account, the Best Money Market Account. “the best place to stash cash,” and the Best Savings Account.\n","\n","Controversies\n","A 60 Minutes segment (originally aired May 7, 2006) examined Sallie Mae, including its business practices. Senator Elizabeth Warren, then a professor at Harvard Law School and sharp critic of what she characterizes as unfair lending practices, questioned Sallie Mae's dual role as lender and collector of student loans.In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae. On April 11, 2007, Cuomo ended his investigation of Sallie Mae and announced that Sallie Mae had voluntarily agreed to change its lending standards to satisfy a new code of conduct for student loan practices established by Cuomo, and to donate $2 million (USD) to a fund devoted to educating college-bound students about their loan options.On October 10, 2007, documents surfaced showing that Sallie Mae was attempting to use the Freedom of Information Act to force colleges to turn over students' personal information. The university involved, the State University of New York system, was expected to decline the request and be forced to defend its position in court.\n","In December 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought against Sallie Mae in a Connecticut federal court alleging that the company discriminated against African American and Hispanic private student loan applicants by charging them high interest rates and fees. The lawsuit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose private student loan terms to unsuspecting students. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, raised similar concerns about possible student loan redlining in June 2007. The lawsuit was settled and dismissed in 2011. Under the terms of the settlement, Sallie Mae agreed to make a $500,000 donation to the United Negro College Fund and the attorneys for the plaintiffs received $1.8 million in attorneys' fees.On January 31, 2008, SLM Corporation paid $35,000,000 to settle a lawsuit for failing to adequately reserve for losses in Sallie Mae's non-traditional portfolio.A False Claims suit was filed against Sallie Mae by former U.S. Department of Education researcher, Dr. Oberg, in 2009. The suit alleges that Sallie Mae and other lenders deliberately overcharged the U.S. government. The findings by Oberg were labeled among higher education policy analysts as the 9.5 scandal.On February 20, 2014, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office announced that an investigation into Sallie Mae's debt collection practices and loan servicing practices had been opened.On November 9, 2005, former Sallie Mae employee Michael Zahara filed a federal lawsuit against the company, alleging that it had a pattern and practice of granting forbearance in a purposeful effort to increase total student loan debt. On October 29, 2008, permission was granted to his legal counsel to withdraw from the case, citing \"From counsel’s perspective, a breakdown in trust has resulted from the discovery that Relator has been arrested for extortion, the circumstances surrounding that arrest, and Relator’s failure to disclose the arrest to counsel.\" On March 12, 2009, the court ruled \"dismissal without prejudice\" because \"the plaintiff has failed to obtain substitute counsel by the deadline.\"\n","\n","Subsidiaries\n","Sallie Mae Bank\n","SLM Financial Corporation\n","\n","\n","Background\n","While campaigning for president in 2020, Joe Biden promised to cancel up to $10,000 of federal student loan debt per borrower. After being elected president, Biden called for the 117th U.S. Congress to pass a bill to facilitate $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. In August 2022, Biden announced that he would use executive action to forgive $10,000 in student loans for borrowers earning less than $125,000 individually and $250,000 as married couples, including an additional $10,000 for Pell Grant recipients. The Biden administration invoked the HEROES Act as the basis for his executive authority to forgive loans. In particular, the administration utilized language that states that the U.S. Secretary of Education has the authority to \"waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs under Title IV\" of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to ensure that \"affected individuals\" are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance. Affected individuals include, among others, those who \"reside or are employed in an area declared a disaster area in connection with a national emergency\" and those who \"suffered direct economic hardship as a result of a war, military operation, or national emergency.\"On September 29, 2022, Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Missouri U.S. District Court challenging the forgiveness program, asserting that it violated the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. The states asserted they had standing because the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 bars them from taxing loans that are discharged for 3 years. Missouri in particular also asserted that it had standing because the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (MOHELA) is a public entity that would lose revenue from student loan forgiveness and become less able to fund Missouri's student financial aid program. On October 20, 2022, district judge Henry Autrey dismissed the suit, holding that the states lacked standing to sue. The states appealed, and on November 14, 2022, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction pending appeal.Separately, on October 10, 2022, two student loan borrowers who did not qualify for the proposed debt forgiveness filed a lawsuit in the Northern Texas U.S. District Court, seeking to vacate the student loan forgiveness program. The borrowers asserted they had standing due to their inability to voice their disagreement with the program through a formal notice-and-comment rule making process required by the Administrative Procedure Act. On November 10, 2022, district judge Mark Pittman issued an order to strike down the student loan forgiveness program. On November 30, 2022, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to issue a hold on the order in response to an appeal from the U.S. Department of Education.\n","\n","Supreme Court\n","After the 8th Circuit granted an injunction pending appeal, the federal government sought to vacate the stay at the Supreme Court on November 18, 2022. On December 1, 2022, the court deferred resolution of the application, granted certiorari before judgment and set the case for argument in the February 2023 sitting. On December 2, 2022, the Biden administration requested that the court either hear the government's appeal from Pittman's order alongside the Nebraska case or issue a hold on his order. On December 12, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the second case initiated by the student loan borrowers, Department of Education v. Brown, jointly with Biden v. Nebraska. On January 4, 2023, the Justice and Education Departments filed a brief with the Court that argued that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate legal injury from the proposal and thereby lacked standing under Article III, and that denied the claims made by the plaintiffs that the administration was overstepping its statutory authority in promulgating the proposal under the HEROES Act.Oral arguments for both Department of Education v. Brown and Biden v. Nebraska were held on February 28, 2023. Many journalists and legal commentators stated that, based on oral arguments, the Court seemed likely to overturn the Biden debt relief program.On June 30, 2023, the Court issued a 6–3 decision for Biden v. Nebraska, striking down the debt forgiveness program. The majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. After first establishing that at least Missouri had Article III standing to challenge the debt forgiveness program, Roberts held that the statutory grant of authority to the Secretary of Education to 'waive or modify' loan terms could not be extended to the student loan forgiveness program, and that a debt cancellation of this scale required clear congressional authorization and fell under the major questions doctrine. The Court also issued a unanimous decision authored by Justice Alito for Department of Education v. Brown, holding that the plaintiffs did not have standing.The dissenting opinion was authored by Justice Elena Kagan and joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n","\n","Impact\n","President Biden responded to the Supreme Court's decision by pledging a new effort to cancel student loans by utilizing the Higher Education Act of 1965. Biden was one of several Democrats that also contrasted the debt forgiveness program with the Paycheck Protection Program, which had by the date of the decision forgiven around $757 billion in loans, including to several Republican lawmakers' businesses; Biden stated \"I was trying to provide students with $10,000 to $20,000 in relief. The average amount forgiven in the PPP program was $70,000. The hypocrisy is stunning.\"\n","\n","\n","History\n","President George H. W. Bush authorized a pilot version of the Direct Loan program, by signing into law the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act was passed to give greater college access to women and minorities.President Bill Clinton set a phase-in of direct lending, by signing into law the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, although in 1994 the 104th Congress passed legislation to prevent the switch to 100% direct lending.Funding for new direct loans in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program increased from $12.6 billion in 2005 to $17.8 billion in 2008.President Barack Obama organized all new loans under the Direct Loan program by July 2010. The switch to 100% Direct Lending effective July 1, 2010 was enacted by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.\n","In 1940, only about 500,000 Americans attended college, but by 1970 that number was near 7.5 million and now in 2018 that number is estimated to be around 14 million. Since 1970, family incomes for 80% of Americans have failed to make inflation-adjusted gains. With college costs skyrocketing, the lack of wage increases forced most students to rely on student aid and student loans.In comparison, other countries have also experimented with government-sponsored loan programs. New Zealand, for instance, now offers 0% interest loans to students who live in New Zealand for 183 or more consecutive days (retroactive for all former students who had government loans), who can repay their loans based on their income after they graduate. This program was a Labour Party promise in the 2005 general election.\n","\n","Main Types of Loans\n","There are four types of direct loans:Direct PLUS Loan: The direct PLUS loan is a federal loan that graduate or professional students and parents of undergraduate students can use to pay for their education. These loans can be used to help pay for education expenses not covered by financial aid. The Direct PLUS loan is not based on financial need, but credit is necessary. Eligibility is determined by the school and once the student has signed, he or she has entered into a legally binding agreement to repay all the loans. In a parent PLUS loan, the parent can authorize the school to use the loan for other educationally related charges after tuition and room and board.\n","Direct Subsidized: A direct subsidized federal loan is for eligible students to cover costs at a four year institution, community college, or vocational school. Only students with demonstrated financial need are eligible and the amount is determined by the school. The US Department of Education pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and he or she gets a grace period of six months after graduating.\n","Direct Unsubsidized: Unlike Subsidized loans, these federal loans do not require students to demonstrate financial need and they are responsible for paying interest on the loan during all periods. If the student chooses not to pay the interest while in school, the interest will accumulate and be added to the principal.\n","Direct Consolidation: These loans enable the student to consolidate multiple federal loans into one loan at no added cost. If a student has multiple loans, he or she can consolidate multiple monthly payments into one monthly payment at the average rate of the loans being consolidated.  One disadvantage is that students cannot lower their interest rates. The interest rate is equal to a weighted average of the interest rates on their current federal student loans, rounded up to the nearest 1/8%.\n","\n","Current program size\n","Currently, there are $1.2 trillion in principal and interest on direct loans remained outstanding (borrowed by 34.5 million individuals). At the end of 2019, there were $657 billion in outstanding Direct Loan program loans for 32.1 million recipients. The Federal Student Aid office (FSA), which is responsible for managing the outstanding loan portfolio, reported that at the end of 2009 there were $1.5 trillion of loans outstanding which is spread out over 42.9 million unduplicated recipients. In 10 years, the loan program experienced 230% growth in the loan portfolio and 130% growth in the loan recipients. Student loan debt in 2019 is the highest it has ever been. According to the latest loan debt statistics, student loan debt has become the second highest consumer debt category behind mortgage debt. The government combats this large outstanding balance with student loan forgiveness which come in several forms, the two most popular being Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Looking at Public Service Loan Forgiveness, there are 890,516 borrowers and 41,221 submitted applications, only 423 of these applications were approved. This translated into about $12.3 million of forgiven loans, leaving the rest of the hundreds of millions left to be paid. Unsurprisingly, the states with the largest populations have the largest proportions of debt. California, Florida, Texas, and New York represent more than 20% of all student debt ($340 billion).Loan portfolio balances managed by the FSA for the Federal Family Education Loan Program are slowly and steadily shrinking as new loans offered to students by the U.S. Department of Education now originate under the FDSLP. Most of the growth in FDSLP loan portfolio balances can be attributed to the number of new loans, as it is now the sole government program for student loans. Another contributor to the rapid escalation in loan balances is due to the cost of higher education increasing rapidly, faster than inflation. Students are spending and borrowing more to finance their higher-priced higher education.\n","\n","Default\n","Default and delinquency are increasingly common and are a large risk the government bears when giving out low-interest rate loans. Delinquency is . It will result in the late payments or missing payments being reported to the credit bureaus and credit scores being adjusted accordingly.  and the consequences are much more severe. A borrower is considered to have defaulted when he or she fails to make required payments for 270 days. When a loan is in default, the principal and interest are due in full a well as collection costs. The current default rate for the 1.56 trillion total outstanding dollars of debt among 44.7 million borrowers is 11.4%. According to estimates made in 2018 from the Department of Education reports, 40% of borrowers are expected to default on their loans by 2023. Over the average length of repayment which is 19 years, 250,000 students default on their loans each quarter while 1.5 trillion outstanding dollars are still supposed to be paid. Defaulting can disqualify a student for any additional Title IV federal student aid in the future. In many instances, the payment of federal student loans will cover any interest accruing between payments. However, if interest accrues between payments of the loan then the lender can capitalize the accrued interest by increasing the principal balance of the loan. The growing principal balance results in higher interest payments and a greater overall cost of the loan.Pew Charitable Trusts research highlights the increasing number of student loan borrowers who encounter repayment problems or interruptions. As of October 2018, the number of student loan borrowers in default in the United States was more than 8 million, which equates to about 1 in 5 federal student loan borrowers. The numbers may even be understated because of the large number of students still in school or within the grace period. As previously mentioned, default consequences are severe and can include damaged credit, ineligibility for future student loans, garnishment of wages, high collection fees, loss of federal income tax refunds or Social Security and prohibition from other federal assistance programs. Additionally, the increasing number of defaults has an impact on the taxpayer. The federal government spent more than $600 million in 2016 and projects costs to exceed more than $1 billion in the near future.For comparison, a study published in 1997 that draws back from the 1980s established that one-fifth of undergraduates borrow in the Stafford Loan previously known as the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Freshmen could only borrow $2625, $3500 for sophomores, and $5500 for each year thereafter without collateral or credit. Now Freshmen can borrow $5500, Sophomores $6500, and juniors $7500. The study predicted that students failing to repay those loans would be a huge cost to the government, which we now know is true. The estimate was that in the 1990s the defaulted student loans would cost the government at least two to three billion dollars each year. From the graphic 1 above, it is apparent that the number of students entering default has surmounted that estimate.\n","\n","Associated problems and proposed solutions\n","Some believe that the growth of student loan debt is reaching problematic levels. Economists point to a drag on the economy as a whole because of high levels of student debt. One way that has been suggested to help students with loan repayment is to lower interest on balances. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal urged, \"We must reduce the student loan interest rate back to 3.4 percent immediately, and then even lower, and develop ways for past students to reduce and erase the $1 trillion in existing debt. The failure of Congress to act now threatens our all too slow and fragile economic recovery and job creation.\" Another way to deal with debt to income levels is to require higher learning accountability. \"Only recently have government regulators demanded accountability for the educational benefits universities produce and the efficiency with which they produce them: What does college cost? How many students are admitted? How many graduate? How long does it take them to graduate? How many get good jobs? At the same time, accrediting bodies have changed their measurement emphasis from inputs and activities to outcomes...Students want not just high-paying jobs, but an acceptable ratio of starting salary to student debt. Governments likewise care not just about the number of graduates but the total cost of producing each graduate.\" These questions warrant consideration in the future conversations about the Federal Student Loan Program.\n","Another solution to the problem was discussed in the 2020 Presidential Election. Candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both offered programs for loan forgiveness. Senator Bernie Sanders proposed canceling all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the United States while Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed canceling $640 billion of the debt. Both have goals to make public university tuition free, reducing the need for borrowing. According to the Department of Education, 45% of student loans are used to attend public colleges and universities. The department also reports that 40% of loans are taken out to attend graduate or professional school, meaning most loans are taken out for post-graduate education or private schools. So even if all debt is wiped out, the rate at which it grows would remain the same. These plans would also have unintended consequences, demonstrating that future debt could be forgiven as well.The Stafford Student Loan Program is a subsidized loan that has been criticized for its lack of reform. Its structure has not changed much since its creation in 1965. The problems are that it is too costly, a wasteful subsidy for middle-income students, acts as disincentive for students to save, and providing an incentive for colleges to raise tuition. The issue that it is a disincentive for students to save is widely cited. The government is issuing cheap loans that are widely available and more than ever, students are attending expensive schools and are less worried about their ability to repay the debt. Students are not incentivized to attend schools with lower tuition. This is exacerbated by the fact that federal financial aids provides less support for students going to community college. They are low cost institutions to begin with but are disadvantaged by both state and federal aid. Data was collected by the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the results of the study revealed that the percentage of lower-income students receiving federal aid awards significantly favored private proprietary and non-profit 2-year students and institutions. The average federal grant allocation to students attending public community colleges was 49% lower than federal awards granted to private baccalaureate institution students. Also, only one in three public community college students from the lowest income group received federal grant aid while three out of every four students at private baccalaureate institutions received this aid.It is apparent that at the individual level student loan debt affects students when it comes to their credit worthiness and future financial stability. In aggregate, the large portfolio of loans can hamper economic growth.\n","\n","\n","A Federal Perkins Loan, or Perkins Loan, was a need-based student loan part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, offered by the U.S. Department of Education to assist American college students in funding their post-secondary education.  The program was named after Carl D. Perkins, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Kentucky.\n","Perkins Loans carried a fixed interest rate of 5% for the duration of the ten-year repayment period. The Perkins Loan Program had a nine-month grace period, so that borrowers began repayment in the tenth month upon graduating, falling below half-time status, or withdrawing from their college or university. Since the Perkins Loan was subsidized by the government, interest did not begin to accrue until the borrower began to repay the loan. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the loan limits for undergraduates were $5,500 per year with a lifetime maximum loan of $27,500.  For graduate students, the limit was $8,000 per year with a lifetime limit of $60,000 (including undergraduate loans).\n","Perkins Loans were eligible for Federal Loan Cancellation for individuals choosing to work in a number of different public service occupations including early childhood education, elementary and secondary school teaching, speech therapy, nursing, law enforcement, librarian, public defense attorney, fire fighting and certain active duty military postings.  Depending on the field of employment, further restrictions on the setting of employment may apply.  For example, forgiveness for teachers may be restricted to designated low-income schools or specific teacher shortage areas such as math, science, and bilingual education and forgiveness for nurses requires employment at a non-profit medical facility. A percentage of the loan was cancelled for each year spent teaching full-time (as long as the loan remains in good standing). This cancellation also applies to Peace Corps Volunteers.  Cancellation typically occurs on a graduating scale: 15% for year 1, 15% for year 2, 20% for year 3, 20% for year 4, 30% for year 5.  These percentages were based on the original debt amount.  Thus after 3 years of service, one would have 50% of their original debt cancelled.On September 30, 2017, the Federal Perkins Loan program failed to renew in Congress, thus effectively ending the loan program.\n","\n","\n","A Stafford Loan was a student loan offered from the United States Department of Education  to eligible students enrolled in accredited American institutions of higher education to help finance their education. The terms of the loans are described in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (with subsequent amendments), which guarantees repayment to the lender if a student defaults. As of July 1, 2010, Stafford Loans are no longer being offered, having been replaced with the William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program.\n","In 1988, Congress renamed the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan program the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan program, in honor of U.S. Senator Robert Stafford, a Republican from Vermont, for his work on higher education.Stafford loans were guaranteed by the full faith of the US government, and were offered at a lower interest rate than the borrower would otherwise be able to get for a private loan. On the other hand, there were strict eligibility requirements and borrowing limits on Stafford Loans.\n","As with other types of federal financial aid, students who applied for a Stafford Loan were required to complete a FAFSA. While the student was enrolled for at least half-time they were not expected to pay any principal payments on the loan, a status referred to as in-school deferment. Deferment of repayment continued for six months after the student leaves school by graduating, dropping below half-time enrollment, or withdrawing, referred to as the grace period.\n","Stafford Loans were available both as subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans are offered to students based on demonstrated financial need (see Expected Family Contribution). The interest on subsidized loans is paid by the federal government while the student is in school and during authorized deferment. For unsubsidized Stafford Loans, students are responsible for all of the interest that accrues while the student is enrolled in school. The interest may be deferred throughout enrollment. Unpaid interest that is deferred until after graduation is capitalized (added to the loan principal).\n","The Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated subsidized Stafford loans for graduate and professional students effective July 1, 2012. Unsubsidized Stafford loans are still available to these students.\n","\n","Interest rates\n","Interest rates on Stafford Loans may vary and are determined based upon the date the loan was disbursed. They may also vary by the education level (undergraduate or graduate) of the student.  Interest rates do not vary with default risk: all students receive the same interest rate regardless of their major or their future employment prospects.For variable rate loans, the rates are set annually using the price of the 91-day Treasury bill on the last Monday of May, and become effective for the following year on July 1. For fiscal year 2008–2009, the 91-day Treasury bill auctioned on May 27, 2008, at 1.905% (rounded to 1.91%) was used for the calculation.  On May 26, 2009, the 91-day Treasury bill was auctioned at an investment rate of 0.178%. On July 1, 2009, the base rate for variable rate Stafford Loans were adjusted to 0.18%. Loans issued before July 1, 1998, were adjusted to a rate of 3.28%.  Loans issued between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 2006, were adjusted to a rate of 2.48%.\n","On August 9, 2013, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, changing how student loan interest rates are determined. The bill links student loan rates to the Federal 10-year Treasury rate, plus a small margin. The new rates are retroactive for all loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013. That effectively reversed an increase in interest rate from 3.40% to 6.80% for affected loans. Federal student loan interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan; however, the rates for new loans will change annually, based on the current market. The interest rates for the 2013–2014 academic year are as follows: 3.86% for undergraduate Stafford Loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) 5.41% for graduate Stafford Loans\n","\n","\n","Financial Aid at Curlie\n","A PLUS Loan is a student loan, which is part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, offered to parents of students enrolled at least half time, or graduate and professional students, at participating and eligible post-secondary institutions. The original, now obsolete, meaning of the acronym was \"Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students\".\n","\n","Similarities with Stafford and Perkins loans\n","PLUS loans share some similarities with the Stafford and Perkins loans offered to students:\n","Offered under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (with subsequent amendments) and are therefore backed by the full faith of the United States Government\n","Can be consolidated through the federal student loan consolidation program\n","\n","Differences from Stafford and Perkins loans\n","There are no limits on the amount borrowed up to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid. Living expenses are considered part of the cost of attendance.\n","The repayment schedule for Direct PLUS Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 is the same as the schedule for Stafford loans. However, for Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed before July 1, 2008, the repayment period begins at the time the PLUS loan is fully disbursed, and the first payment is due within 60 days after the final disbursement. Repayment may be deferred while at least a half-time student; however, the unpaid interest is added to the principal.\n","The interest rate is currently fixed at 6.28% and charged from the date of the first disbursement until the loan is paid in full.\n","For undergraduate students, the loan is a commitment by the parent, rather than the student.\n","Several different repayment plans are available.\n","Credit history is taken into account, while with Stafford loans it is not.\n","Do not have the postponement and discharge (cancellation) options available with Stafford loans.\n","\n","Changes as of July 1, 2006\n","Like the Stafford Loan program, the PLUS program changed to a higher, but fixed rate, structure for loans disbursed after midnight, July 1, 2006. The rate offered through the Direct Loan Program was 7.9%. Additionally, the PLUS program was made available for graduate and professional students to borrow to finance their own educations, commonly referred to as the Grad PLUS loan.\n","\n","Changes as of July 1, 2008\n","For PLUS loans made to parents that are first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, the borrower has the option of beginning repayment on the PLUS loan either 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed or wait until six months after the dependent student on whose behalf the parent borrowed ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uqUqh7yy19my"},"source":["**Question**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"e88tB1pc1D-_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701573312427,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Ureem James","userId":"12473310198316461181"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# question = \"What is FAFSA?\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cmWLeIni2Gn-"},"source":["**Perform Q & A**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1700,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701573433867,"user":{"displayName":"Ureem James","userId":"12473310198316461181"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ca2weTFs1QRM","outputId":"4df42ffe-d678-46a8-f415-59c38c6910d0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Answer: severe\n","Score: 0.5106918215751648\n"]}],"source":["question = \"What are default consequences?\"\n","\n","context = \"\"\"A borrower is considered to have defaulted when he or she fails to make required payments for 270 days. When a loan is in default, the principal and interest are due in full a well as collection costs. The current default rate for the 1.56 trillion total outstanding dollars of debt among 44.7 million borrowers is 11.4%. According to estimates made in 2018 from the Department of Education reports, 40% of borrowers are expected to default on their loans by 2023. Over the average length of repayment which is 19 years, 250,000 students default on their loans each quarter while 1.5 trillion outstanding dollars are still supposed to be paid. Defaulting can disqualify a student for any additional Title IV federal student aid in the future. In many instances, the payment of federal student loans will cover any interest accruing between payments. However, if interest accrues between payments of the loan then the lender can capitalize the accrued interest by increasing the principal balance of the loan. The growing principal balance results in higher interest payments and a greater overall cost of the loan.Pew Charitable Trusts research highlights the increasing number of student loan borrowers who encounter repayment problems or interruptions. As of October 2018, the number of student loan borrowers in default in the United States was more than 8 million, which equates to about 1 in 5 federal student loan borrowers. The numbers may even be understated because of the large number of students still in school or within the grace period. As previously mentioned, default consequences are severe and can include damaged credit, ineligibility for future student loans, garnishment of wages, high collection fees, loss of federal income tax refunds or Social Security and prohibition from other federal assistance programs. Additionally, the increasing number of defaults has an impact on the taxpayer. The federal government spent more than $600 million in 2016 and projects costs to exceed more than $1 billion in the near future.For comparison, a study published in 1997 that draws back from the 1980s established that one-fifth of undergraduates borrow in the Stafford Loan previously known as the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Freshmen could only borrow $2625, $3500 for sophomores, and $5500 for each year thereafter without collateral or credit. Now Freshmen can borrow $5500, Sophomores $6500, and juniors $7500. The study predicted that students failing to repay those loans would be a huge cost to the government, which we now know is true. The estimate was that in the 1990s the defaulted student loans would cost the government at least two to three billion dollars each year. From the graphic 1 above, it is apparent that the number of students entering default has surmounted that estimate. \"\"\"\n","\n","result = question_answering(question=question, context=context)\n","print(\"Answer:\", result['answer'])\n","print(\"Score:\", result['score'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":61189,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701225530125,"user":{"displayName":"Ureem James","userId":"12473310198316461181"},"user_tz":300},"id":"XAqzRBnEfOTl","outputId":"4183d739-0906-4c1f-a8a9-296755138200"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Answer: severe\n","Score: 0.3383679986000061\n"]}],"source":["# context = \"\"\"\n","\n","# Eligibility\n","# In order to receive federal student financial aid, students must meet the following criteria: have maintained a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP); be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an eligible non-citizen; have a valid Social Security number;\n","# have a high school diploma or GED; have signed the certification statement stating that: 1) they are not in default on a federal student loan and do not owe money on a federal student grant and 2) federal student aid will only be used for educational purposes;\n","# have not been found guilty of the sale or possession of illegal drugs while federal aid was being received.Male students between the ages of 18 and 25 were generally required be registered with the Selective Service System (for Conscription in the United States), but the FAFSA Simplification Act removed this requirement starting with the 2021–2022 school year.

These loans can be used to help pay for education expenses not covered by financial aid. The Direct PLUS loan is not based on financial need, but credit is necessary. Eligibility is determined by the school and once the student has signed, he or she has entered into a legally binding agreement to repay all the loans. In a parent PLUS loan, the parent can authorize the school to use the loan for other educationally related charges after tuition and room and board.\n","Direct Subsidized: A direct subsidized federal loan is for eligible students to cover costs at a four year institution, community college, or vocational school. Only students with demonstrated financial need are eligible and the amount is determined by the school. The US Department of Education pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and he or she gets a grace period of six months after graduating.\n","Direct Unsubsidized: Unlike Subsidized loans, these federal loans do not require students to demonstrate financial need and they are responsible for paying interest on the loan during all periods. If the student chooses not to pay the interest while in school, the interest will accumulate and be added to the principal.\n","Direct Consolidation: These loans enable the student to consolidate multiple federal loans into one loan at no added cost. If a student has multiple loans, he or she can consolidate multiple monthly payments into one monthly payment at the average rate of the loans being consolidated.  One disadvantage is that students cannot lower their interest rates. The interest rate is equal to a weighted average of the interest rates on their current federal student loans, rounded up to the nearest 1/8%.\n","\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","question = \"What is the
